00:02:23,788 --> 00:02:24,812

How do you know my name?

24
00:03:24,516 --> 00:03:27,651
I am the last of the

25
00:03:28,910 --> 00:03:33,084
Sworn to protect realms
from the Seven Deadly Sins.

26
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:38,768
For years have passed

27
00:03:39,561 --> 00:03:41,497
and I have grown weak.

28
00:03:41,859 --> 00:03:46,161
That is why I seek a
champion to inherit my magic.

29
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:49,262
You want me
to do magic?

30
00:03:49,468 --> 00:03:50,849
With this,

31
00:03:51,704 --> 00:03:54,744
all of my powers
will become yours.

32
00:04:00,868 --> 00:04:02,345
But first,

33
00:04:03,289 --> 00:04:06,162
you must demonstrate that
you're pure of heart

34
00:04:06,222 --> 00:04:08,150
and strong in spirit.

35
00:04:11,253 --> 00:04:13,427
He lies.

36
00:04:14,278 --> 00:04:17,763
Don't be his champion.

37

We can give you power.

38

40

No!

43

I know it.

171
00:14:13,773 --> 00:14:16,512
There's a couple outside,
Mr. Batson.

172
00:14:16,615 --> 00:14:18,305
They run a group home.

173
00:14:19,812 --> 00:14:21,272
I can take care of myself.

174
00:14:21,387 --> 00:14:22,697
When you're 18.

175
00:14:23,022 --> 00:14:24,307
Until then,

176
00:14:24,332 --> 00:14:25,673
I won't have you
living on the streets

177
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:28,411
looking for someone
who never looked for you.

178
00:14:29,210 --> 00:14:30,925
Give these people a chance.

179
00:14:31,402 --> 00:14:33,083
'Cause that's what
they're giving you.

180
00:14:33,948 --> 00:14:35,345
You're out of options.

181
00:14:46,401 --> 00:14:47,758
All right, let's get the spiel.

182
00:14:47,806 --> 00:14:49,768
Just stay with me and Rosa,
we get it.

183
00:14:49,863 --> 00:14:51,331
We were foster kids
back in the day.

184
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:52,784
Ooh, back in the dark ages.

185
00:14:52,924 --> 00:14:54,046
Girl!

186
00:14:54,071 --> 00:14:55,347
I'm young at heart.

187
00:14:55,598 --> 00:14:56,942
Got my finger on the pulse.

188
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,981
Yeah, that's a reference to his
blood pressure because he's old.

189
00:15:00,082 --> 00:15:01,495
Billy, do you have
any food allergies?

190
00:15:01,543 --> 00:15:03,342
Oh, wish you did.
Darla's cookin'.

191
00:15:03,384 --> 00:15:04,809
- Oy, guerito!
- What?

192
00:15:07,221 --> 00:15:09,293
We know how overwhelming
it can all be.

193
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:10,880
New house, new faces.

194
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:12,525
All up in your face.

195
00:15:12,656 --> 00:15:15,053
Just...
take it at your own speed.

196
00:15:25,196 --> 00:15:26,387
Hello?

197
00:15:30,737 --> 00:15:31,935
We're home!

198
00:15:31,975 --> 00:15:34,062
That's what happens
when you suck!

199
00:15:35,368 --> 00:15:37,090
So much for the welcome party.

200
00:15:37,252 --> 00:15:40,252
Yeah, that thing growing out
of the couch would be Eugene.

201
00:15:40,786 --> 00:15:42,056
Is that him?

202
00:15:42,137 --> 00:15:43,748
Oh, my gosh! Billy!

203
00:15:43,820 --> 00:15:45,241
Whoa, slow down, slow down!

204
00:15:45,394 --> 00:15:46,577
Welcome home!

205
00:15:46,616 --> 00:15:48,490
- And that's Darla.
- I'm Darla.

206
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:49,529
Big hugger.

207
00:15:49,554 --> 00:15:50,567
I noticed.

208
00:15:50,868 --> 00:15:52,788
Die! Die! Die!

209
00:15:53,078 --> 00:15:55,180
He doesn't mean that.
It's the game.

210
00:15:57,496 --> 00:15:58,628
Hey.

211
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:00,527
No sodas after dark, remember?

212
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,101
Whoa. When did it get dark?

213
00:16:03,159 --> 00:16:05,699
Oh, the poster. I made you one.
Come look!

214
00:16:06,122 --> 00:16:08,345
Oh, no!

215
00:16:08,475 --> 00:16:10,827
Sorry, Pedro must've been
working out.

216
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:13,133
He was supposed
to be at school.

217
00:16:14,589 --> 00:16:15,644
Oh.

218
00:16:15,902 --> 00:16:16,933
Here.

219
00:16:18,236 --> 00:16:19,236
Yes.

220
00:16:19,261 --> 00:16:22,546
Exactly why your Math Department
is so uniquely suited for me.

221
00:16:23,523 --> 00:16:25,539
I can't, I can't even...
with Eugene right now.

222
00:16:25,706 --> 00:16:27,293
Sorry. Mary. Hi.

223
00:16:27,380 --> 00:16:28,523
College interview.

224
00:16:28,566 --> 00:16:30,892
- I'm Billy.
- What am I most excited about?

225
00:16:31,108 --> 00:16:32,116
Oh.

226
00:16:32,188 --> 00:16:35,069
What a great question.
I was hoping you'd ask.

227
00:16:37,281 --> 00:16:39,940
Mention you're a foster kid.
Colleges eat that up.

228
00:16:40,461 --> 00:16:42,318
What I'm most excited about

229
00:16:42,343 --> 00:16:43,796
is the campus experience.

230
00:16:43,821 --> 00:16:45,717
As a foster child,
I'm a big believer

231
00:16:45,742 --> 00:16:47,970
in finding family and
friends in the most

232
00:16:47,995 --> 00:16:49,616
unlikely of places.

233
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,599
Oh, I'm gonna miss
that girl so much!

234
00:16:54,681 --> 00:16:56,466
It's Caltech,
it's a very prestigious school.

235
00:16:56,643 --> 00:16:58,475
And also all the way
in California.

236
00:16:58,519 --> 00:17:00,717
But we don't have to talk
about that right now.

237
00:17:00,781 --> 00:17:02,432
It's a tough subject for me.

238
00:17:02,498 --> 00:17:03,720
Do you like vegan food?

239
00:17:03,767 --> 00:17:05,617
- Mm-mm.
- 'Cause, see, I love animals.

240
00:17:07,934 --> 00:17:09,338
Oh, no! The tofurkey!

241
00:17:09,370 --> 00:17:11,330
Oh, no, we may have
to eat a real turkey!

242
00:17:11,362 --> 00:17:14,067
- Is that?
- It's okay. Come, I'll show you your room.

243
00:17:14,439 --> 00:17:17,058
It's a bit of a madhouse,
I know, but,

244
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:18,375
it's fun!

245
00:17:20,466 --> 00:17:21,529
Watch the bumps there.

246
00:17:21,585 --> 00:17:23,966
Pedro, mi amor, hola.

247
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:25,144
Say hi to Billy.

248
00:17:26,900 --> 00:17:29,480
Don't take it personally.
He's like that with everyone.

249
00:17:33,505 --> 00:17:34,616
Freddy.

250
00:17:35,743 --> 00:17:37,251
This is Billy Batson.

251
00:17:38,016 --> 00:17:40,072
Make sure you make him
feel at home, okay?

252
00:17:40,432 --> 00:17:42,027
Maybe don't say anything
too weird?

253
00:17:42,154 --> 00:17:43,297
Oh, one weird thing is

254
00:17:43,322 --> 00:17:45,916
you know the Romans used to
brush their teeth with their urine?

255
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:49,527
Apparently, it-it works.

256
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:51,529
Yup, um...

257
00:18:00,506 --> 00:18:02,640
Oh, it's, uh...
it's a long way down.

258
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:05,529
Trust me, I speak from experience.

259
00:18:08,871 --> 00:18:10,577
Victor pushed me.

260
00:18:11,109 --> 00:18:13,680
They seem nice,
but don't buy it.

261
00:18:14,592 --> 00:18:16,925
It gets real Game of Thrones
around here.

262
00:18:18,454 --> 00:18:19,517
What?

263
00:18:20,582 --> 00:18:23,233
Dude, I'm... just messin' around.

264
00:18:23,391 --> 00:18:25,876
It's um, it's terminal cancer, I...

265
00:18:26,078 --> 00:18:27,801
I have three months.

266
00:18:29,049 --> 00:18:30,421
Kidding, again!

267
00:18:30,446 --> 00:18:31,968
You look at me and you're, like,
"Why so dark?"

268
00:18:31,993 --> 00:18:34,445
"You're a disabled foster kid,
you've got it all." Right?

269
00:18:36,438 --> 00:18:39,105
Oh, yeah, that's the, uh,
the old batarang.

270
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:40,918
I mean, it's a replica, but...

271
00:18:41,109 --> 00:18:42,410
Feel how sharp.

272
00:18:42,712 --> 00:18:44,531
Could kill you in your sleep
with that thing.

273
00:18:45,556 --> 00:18:47,128
You ever a Supes guy?

274
00:18:47,619 --> 00:18:48,830
Yeah, me too.

275
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:51,496
Behold, the holy grail.

276
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:54,136
One nine millimeter round
shot at Superman himself.

277
00:18:54,239 --> 00:18:55,327
It's legit.

278
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:58,093
Probably worth, I dunno,
$5-600, maybe more.

279
00:18:58,816 --> 00:18:59,872
What's in the bag?

280
00:19:00,189 --> 00:19:01,189
Hey.

281
00:19:01,214 --> 00:19:03,508
Hey, it's all good.
It's good to maintain boundaries.

282
00:19:05,167 --> 00:19:06,864
You don't gotta
talk so much, you know.

283
00:19:08,443 --> 00:19:10,919
I mean, this place is great.
You're gonna love it.

284
00:19:35,283 --> 00:19:36,442
Dinner!

285
00:19:43,675 --> 00:19:45,405
All hands on deck!

286
00:19:47,590 --> 00:19:48,765
Sweet.

287
00:19:48,947 --> 00:19:50,431
Thank you for this family.

288
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,053
Thank you for this day.

289
00:19:52,212 --> 00:19:53,791
Thank you for this food.

290
00:19:53,851 --> 00:19:55,653
Even if it's not steak fillet.

291
00:19:59,171 --> 00:20:01,782
Big school. 2,000 students,
you might think,

292
00:20:01,828 --> 00:20:03,402
"Wow, so many strangers."

293
00:20:03,427 --> 00:20:05,039
But not if you think of them as

294
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,595
possible for each friend then,

295
00:20:06,645 --> 00:20:08,133
"Oh, so many friends."

296
00:20:08,583 --> 00:20:11,432
The principal, her name's
Shirley. She's the best.

297
00:20:11,791 --> 00:20:12,791
Next.

298
00:20:13,739 --> 00:20:15,469
This is our security scanner.

299
00:20:15,494 --> 00:20:17,636
Like in an airport.
It's totally safe.

300
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,312
I know what it is.

301
00:20:19,783 --> 00:20:21,148
Does she always do this?

302
00:20:21,851 --> 00:20:24,160
Silence makes me uncomfortable.

303
00:20:24,248 --> 00:20:26,569
She's almost never uncomfortable.

304
00:20:29,142 --> 00:20:30,777
Have a good first day,
big brother.

305
00:20:30,832 --> 00:20:32,785
Look, you don't have
to hug me all the time.

306
00:20:32,896 --> 00:20:35,230
We're not actually
brother and sister, so.

307
00:20:36,995 --> 00:20:38,336
I'm sorry.

308
00:20:41,736 --> 00:20:43,855
- Hey.
- Hey.

309
00:20:43,933 --> 00:20:45,760
I-I didn't mean to make her...

310
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:51,119
<i>I was overwhelmed, honestly.</i>

311
00:20:52,831 --> 00:20:55,728
<i>He said I must be pure of heart.</i>

312
00:20:55,904 --> 00:20:58,587
<i>He called himself a wizard.</i>

313
00:20:58,671 --> 00:21:00,322
<i>Just like a...</i>

314
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:03,116
<i>a wizard from Harry Potter, some...</i>

315
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:07,241
<i>But y-you're saying that other
people have experienced this?</i>

316
00:21:07,292 --> 00:21:08,776
In a sense, yes.

317
00:21:09,458 --> 00:21:11,522
Do you remember
what he said to you?

318
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,736
<i>He tested me.</i>

319
00:21:14,439 --> 00:21:17,034
<i>There were these statues.</i>

320
00:21:17,189 --> 00:21:19,196
<i>Their eyes, it's like
they were looking at me,</i>

321
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:21,025
<i>making me think things.</i>

322
00:21:21,224 --> 00:21:22,685
<i>Like, horrible things.</i>

323
00:21:23,013 --> 00:21:25,457
And do these approximate
what you saw?

324
00:21:26,904 --> 00:21:30,119
<i>Yes. That's exactly
how I remember it.</i>

325
00:21:30,402 --> 00:21:32,503
<i>I-I don't understand.
How do you know...?</i>

326
00:21:32,545 --> 00:21:34,506
Recurring imagery has
proven very common

327
00:21:34,531 --> 00:21:36,503
in cases of mass hysteria.

328
00:21:36,709 --> 00:21:37,979
<i>"Mass hysteria"?</i>

329
00:21:38,004 --> 00:21:39,089
I know.

330
00:21:39,114 --> 00:21:40,932
The term's a bit theatrical.

331
00:21:40,957 --> 00:21:43,316
But take UFO sightings,
for example.

332
00:21:43,519 --> 00:21:45,789
Lights in the sky,
flying saucers.

333
00:21:45,948 --> 00:21:49,202
Isolated incidents of people
who do not know each other...

334
00:21:49,289 --> 00:21:50,516
Symbols.

335
00:21:54,468 --> 00:21:56,030
Ask her about the symbols.

336
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,786
Sorry, Ms. Kwan.

337
00:21:58,937 --> 00:22:01,580
But as an example of
recurring imagery,

338
00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:03,593
maybe you recall seeing

339
00:22:03,618 --> 00:22:06,356
these symbols before
the alleged abduction?

340
00:22:07,155 --> 00:22:09,576
<i>Don't remember any symbols, no.</i>

341
00:22:09,888 --> 00:22:13,602
<i>I think I caught it on video.
There was something, um...</i>

342
00:22:13,692 --> 00:22:16,294
<i>I remember the numbers on
my alarm clock, they kept</i>

343
00:22:17,151 --> 00:22:18,302
<i>shifting.</i>

344
00:22:18,368 --> 00:22:19,408
Video?

345
00:22:21,416 --> 00:22:22,852
Show me the video.

346
00:22:23,098 --> 00:22:25,757
Uh, Ms. Kwan,
this is Dr. Sivana.

347
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:28,833
<i>Um, one moment,
I can send it.</i>

348
00:22:30,113 --> 00:22:31,097
<i>Hello?</i>

349
00:22:31,809 --> 00:22:33,959
<i>Oh, my God!
Who's there?</i>

350
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:35,876
<i>Hello?</i>

351
00:22:35,901 --> 00:22:37,933
<i>What's going on?
What's happening?</i>

352
00:22:39,502 --> 00:22:41,621
<i>I'm-I'm going
to call the police.</i>

353
00:22:43,012 --> 00:22:45,615
<i>Then this blinding light
all around me.</i>

354
00:22:45,774 --> 00:22:48,599
<i>And I felt like I was
getting pulled down...</i>

355
00:22:48,683 --> 00:22:51,589
<i>Like a temple
carved inside a mountain...</i>

356
00:22:51,666 --> 00:22:54,565
<i>Exactly what you'd expect from
a guy who call himself a wizard.</i>

357
00:22:54,613 --> 00:22:56,899
<i>...brought there
to save the world.</i>

358
00:22:59,452 --> 00:23:00,841
Dr. Sivana!

359
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:04,065
I appreciate your enthusiasm.

360
00:23:04,226 --> 00:23:06,551
But you're funding my project.

361
00:23:06,576 --> 00:23:09,570
And when I'm interviewing,
I don't wanna be interrupted.

362
00:23:09,684 --> 00:23:11,859
56 reported abductions.

363
00:23:11,884 --> 00:23:13,742
- I never saw it.
- Saw what?

364
00:23:29,528 --> 00:23:31,234
Doctor, what is all this?

365
00:23:31,756 --> 00:23:33,819
All these years...

366
00:23:35,711 --> 00:23:37,326
I was convinced

367
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:40,001
I had the incorrect sequence.

368
00:23:40,057 --> 00:23:41,644
Or perhaps...

369
00:23:41,803 --> 00:23:45,319
the wrong symbols
to open the door.

370
00:23:46,532 --> 00:23:48,952
But on that woman's alarm clock,

371
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,702
the seven symbols.

372
00:23:52,451 --> 00:23:54,229
The sequence

373
00:23:54,665 --> 00:23:56,332
repeating itself

374
00:23:56,864 --> 00:23:58,610
seven times.

375
00:24:00,155 --> 00:24:01,655
That's the difference.

376
00:24:01,705 --> 00:24:03,506
Is this some sort of joke?

377
00:24:03,586 --> 00:24:05,403
It may seem that way to you.

378
00:24:05,716 --> 00:24:08,010
Because we're not, in actuality,

379
00:24:08,036 --> 00:24:09,964
studying mass hysteria.

380
00:24:10,004 --> 00:24:12,115
What all these people have seen,

381
00:24:12,755 --> 00:24:14,787
every single one of them,

382
00:24:14,812 --> 00:24:16,589
is absolutely real.

383
00:24:17,404 --> 00:24:19,625
An alarm clock malfunctions,

384
00:24:19,650 --> 00:24:22,698
and your first thought is
it's proof of a wizard?

385
00:24:23,068 --> 00:24:24,957
Come on, Dr. Sivana.

386
00:24:24,988 --> 00:24:27,456
You can't believe
any of this is real.

387
00:24:40,408 --> 00:24:41,812
Why, yes.

388
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:48,951
Yes, I do.

389
00:25:27,722 --> 00:25:30,328
I've been waiting
for this moment

390
00:25:30,424 --> 00:25:31,733
for so long.

391
00:25:33,606 --> 00:25:35,043
And now, here we are.

392
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,559
You don't remember me, do you?

393
00:25:44,354 --> 00:25:46,314
I remember you.

394
00:25:47,713 --> 00:25:49,277
You were a boy.

395
00:25:49,436 --> 00:25:51,523
Now, you dare intrude
in my kingdom.

396
00:25:51,548 --> 00:25:53,490
Do you know what it's like
for a child to be told,

397
00:25:53,515 --> 00:25:55,388
"You'll never be good enough"?

398
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:56,793
No, you don't.

399
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,766
What you said to me
all those years ago

400
00:25:59,873 --> 00:26:02,302
made me realize
who I really was.

401
00:26:02,406 --> 00:26:04,097
And you know something?

402
00:26:06,562 --> 00:26:08,403
I am not pure of heart.

403
00:26:08,927 --> 00:26:13,760
The wizard is too weak
to stop us.

404
00:26:16,247 --> 00:26:17,310
No.

405
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:18,699
No!

406
00:26:27,661 --> 00:26:30,939
You never found your champion.

407
00:26:31,755 --> 00:26:35,096
But we found ours.

408
00:26:49,771 --> 00:26:53,612
You are the true champion.

409
00:27:25,410 --> 00:27:26,728
They're using you.

410
00:27:27,132 --> 00:27:29,394
You're nothing to them
but a means of escape.

411
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:39,421
Through you, they'll spread the
poison to everything they touch!

412
00:27:40,034 --> 00:27:42,454
Make mankind turn into them.

413
00:27:43,477 --> 00:27:45,777
You seek a pure soul, old man.

414
00:27:46,126 --> 00:27:47,757
But no one's worthy.

415
00:27:58,158 --> 00:27:59,817
Flight or invisibility?

416
00:28:00,872 --> 00:28:02,364
If you could have
one superpower,

417
00:28:02,389 --> 00:28:04,118
flight or invisibility,
what would you pick?

418
00:28:04,461 --> 00:28:07,453
Everybody chooses flight.
You know why?

419
00:28:07,535 --> 00:28:09,265
So they can fly away
from this conversation?

420
00:28:09,309 --> 00:28:10,602
No, 'cause heroes fly.

421
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,594
Who doesn't want people to
think they're a hero, right?

422
00:28:12,685 --> 00:28:16,058
But-But invisibility, no way,
I mean, that's perfect.

423
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:18,110
Spying around on people who
don't even know you're there.

424
00:28:18,135 --> 00:28:19,276
Sneaking around everywhere.

425
00:28:19,301 --> 00:28:20,978
It's a total villain power, right?

426
00:28:28,076 --> 00:28:29,941
Then they did this study,
and this is a real thing.

427
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:31,103
They asked people
the same question,

428
00:28:31,174 --> 00:28:32,705
You know, what power
do you want? But this time,

429
00:28:32,730 --> 00:28:34,293
they made it so the
answers were anonymous.

430
00:28:34,355 --> 00:28:36,394
And-And most people, since
they knew that it was secret,

431
00:28:36,419 --> 00:28:37,585
said invisibility.

432
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:38,806
And I think that's
'cause most people

433
00:28:38,831 --> 00:28:41,355
don't feel like heroes
on the inside, deep down.

434
00:28:41,534 --> 00:28:42,851
You're gonna run away.

435
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,703
I mean, you stole my
Superman bullet.

436
00:28:46,223 --> 00:28:48,112
Dude, I get it, I get it.

437
00:28:48,223 --> 00:28:49,803
You've been screwed over
way too many times.

438
00:28:49,950 --> 00:28:51,228
You don't trust anyone.

439
00:28:51,545 --> 00:28:53,592
But that's the thing
about invisibility.

440
00:28:54,226 --> 00:28:55,834
You handle it by yourself.

441
00:28:57,175 --> 00:28:59,262
I didn't steal your dumb bullet.

442
00:29:04,302 --> 00:29:06,611
Hey, how was it today?

443
00:29:07,316 --> 00:29:08,888
That good, huh?

444
00:29:12,044 --> 00:29:13,092
Whoa!

445
00:29:14,480 --> 00:29:15,993
Oh, my God! Freddy!

446
00:29:16,073 --> 00:29:17,445
You okay?

447
00:29:20,134 --> 00:29:21,206
What the hell?

448
00:29:21,245 --> 00:29:22,897
What is wrong with you two?

449
00:29:23,415 --> 00:29:26,482
- No way that's gonna buff out.
- You gonna pay for that thing?

450
00:29:26,538 --> 00:29:28,212
For the dent you made
almost hitting me?

451
00:29:28,259 --> 00:29:31,331
Yeah, sure, um,
do you guys take these?

452
00:29:34,616 --> 00:29:35,823
Brett, stop!

453
00:29:37,323 --> 00:29:38,736
Don't touch my brother!

454
00:29:38,769 --> 00:29:41,109
What, you need your fake
family to stand up for you?

455
00:29:41,134 --> 00:29:42,796
- Stand up for yourself, man.
- Yeah, huh?

456
00:29:43,454 --> 00:29:45,220
Here, stand up.
Stand up for yourself.

457
00:29:45,406 --> 00:29:47,402
What are you gonna do?
Go home, cry to mommy?

458
00:29:47,491 --> 00:29:49,610
Oh, yeah, you don't
have a mommy.

459
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:51,531
Stop hurting him!

460
00:29:51,558 --> 00:29:52,629
Hey!

461
00:29:55,337 --> 00:29:57,020
Man, sorry about that.

462
00:29:57,045 --> 00:29:58,178
That wasn't fair, but,

463
00:29:58,203 --> 00:29:59,943
then again,
you don't play fair, so.

464
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:07,954
Back off, assbags, I know
how to use these things!

465
00:30:09,851 --> 00:30:10,962
Oh!

466
00:30:13,749 --> 00:30:14,820
Hey!

467
00:30:15,979 --> 00:30:17,675
Freddy, you okay?

468
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,496
Nowhere to run!

469
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:34,012
- Go, go, go!
- Grab him!

470
00:30:34,435 --> 00:30:35,633
Get out of the way!

471
00:30:36,864 --> 00:30:37,967
Whoa!

472
00:30:39,233 --> 00:30:40,360
No, no, no, no!

473
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,448
You're dead, kid!

474
00:30:42,473 --> 00:30:44,141
Yeah, you think you're funny?

475
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,030
I know where you
go to school, right!

476
00:30:48,364 --> 00:30:51,014
<i>Next stop, 30th Street Station.</i>

477
00:30:51,102 --> 00:30:53,642
<i>Change for the Regional Rail Line.</i>

478
00:31:12,426 --> 00:31:13,815
Hello?

479
00:31:14,354 --> 00:31:15,656
What's going on?

480
00:31:30,092 --> 00:31:31,277
Help!

481
00:32:02,748 --> 00:32:04,057
Holy moley.

482
00:32:20,501 --> 00:32:21,573
Hello?

483
00:32:36,566 --> 00:32:37,884
What the hell?

484
00:32:38,086 --> 00:32:40,109
Who-Who's doing this?!

485
00:33:11,706 --> 00:33:13,389
Hi, um...

486
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:16,627
I was supposed
to get off at 30th.

487
00:33:16,668 --> 00:33:18,080
Billy Batson.

488
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:20,275
How'd you know my name?

489
00:33:20,323 --> 00:33:23,918
I am the last of the
consul of wizards.

490
00:33:24,354 --> 00:33:27,013
Keeper of the Rock of Eternity.

491
00:33:27,388 --> 00:33:28,809
Oh.

492
00:33:29,071 --> 00:33:30,938
You're

493
00:33:31,020 --> 00:33:32,374
that guy.

494
00:33:32,567 --> 00:33:34,158
Listen, I don't have any money.

495
00:33:34,265 --> 00:33:36,646
Do not patronize me, boy!

496
00:33:38,598 --> 00:33:42,280
You are standing
in the source of all magic.

497
00:33:42,469 --> 00:33:44,502
The Rock of Eternity.

498
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:47,495
Seven foes, seven wizards.

499
00:33:47,622 --> 00:33:51,052
But long ago,
we chose a champion.

500
00:33:51,132 --> 00:33:53,415
And we chose recklessly.

501
00:33:56,040 --> 00:33:59,272
He used his power for revenge.

502
00:33:59,901 --> 00:34:03,843
Releasing the Seven Deadly
Sins into the world.

503
00:34:07,171 --> 00:34:10,012
Millions of lives were lost.

504
00:34:10,275 --> 00:34:15,156
Entire civilizations
erased from existence.

505
00:34:18,566 --> 00:34:22,166
That is why I vowed
never to pass on my magic

506
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,943
until I find one
truly good person.

507
00:34:27,474 --> 00:34:29,045
Strong in spirit.

508
00:34:29,553 --> 00:34:30,982
Pure in heart.

509
00:34:32,002 --> 00:34:35,930
Look, man, maybe this is magic.

510
00:34:36,063 --> 00:34:38,095
I-I don't know, but,

511
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,456
the people you're looking for,
good, pure people...

512
00:34:41,528 --> 00:34:43,255
I'm not one of them.

513
00:34:43,530 --> 00:34:46,338
I-I don't know if anyone is, really.

514
00:34:46,550 --> 00:34:51,598
You, Billy Batson, are all I have.

515
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:54,283
All the world has.

516
00:34:55,957 --> 00:34:58,314
Lay your hands on this staff.

517
00:34:58,401 --> 00:34:59,472
Gross.

518
00:34:59,568 --> 00:35:02,687
And say my name so my
powers may flow through you.

519
00:35:02,912 --> 00:35:06,373
I open my heart to
you, Billy Batson.

520
00:35:06,487 --> 00:35:10,614
And in so doing,
choose you as champion.

521
00:35:10,824 --> 00:35:13,340
Thanks. Don't scream
at me, mister, but

522
00:35:13,365 --> 00:35:14,848
I really gotta get going.

523
00:35:15,019 --> 00:35:18,574
My brothers and sisters
were slain by the sins.

524
00:35:18,731 --> 00:35:21,763
Their thrones lie empty!

525
00:35:22,042 --> 00:35:24,526
My magic must be passed on.

526
00:35:24,769 --> 00:35:25,872
Now...

527
00:35:26,086 --> 00:35:27,959
Speak my name!

528
00:35:28,237 --> 00:35:29,901
I-I don't know your name, sir.

529
00:35:29,932 --> 00:35:31,108
We just met.

530
00:35:31,226 --> 00:35:34,091
My name is...

531
00:35:34,178 --> 00:35:35,821
Shazam.

532
00:35:38,224 --> 00:35:39,303
Wait, for real?

533
00:35:39,328 --> 00:35:41,056
- Say it!
- Okay.

534
00:35:41,494 --> 00:35:42,582
Jeez.

535
00:35:53,716 --> 00:35:55,025
Should I say it?

536
00:35:55,315 --> 00:35:56,493
Like,

537
00:35:56,795 --> 00:35:58,001
Shazam?

538
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:00,081
Yes!

539
00:36:00,106 --> 00:36:01,402
Carry my name

540
00:36:01,443 --> 00:36:03,517
and with it, you
carry all of my powers.

541
00:36:03,656 --> 00:36:04,946
The wisdom of Solomon!

542
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,346
The strength of Hercules!

543
00:36:06,388 --> 00:36:07,950
The stamina of Atlas!

544
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,681
The power of Zeus!

545
00:36:09,807 --> 00:36:11,353
The courage of Achilles!

546
00:36:11,506 --> 00:36:13,467
And speed of Mercury!

547
00:36:23,609 --> 00:36:25,807
What happened to me?
Why am I...?

548
00:36:25,832 --> 00:36:27,975
W-W-What did you do to me?
What did you do to my voice?

549
00:36:28,014 --> 00:36:32,083
You have been transformed to
your full potential, Billy Batson.

550
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:36,726
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

551
00:36:37,073 --> 00:36:39,898
The thrones of our brothers
and sisters await!

552
00:36:46,259 --> 00:36:48,085
Huh! Oh!

553
00:36:51,913 --> 00:36:53,461
Get me outta here!

554
00:36:55,974 --> 00:36:57,839
Dope!

555
00:36:59,136 --> 00:37:02,080
My brother,
I applaud your choices today.

556
00:37:02,140 --> 00:37:04,497
Gold shoes, gold belt,
white cape!

557
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,046
It shouldn't work,
but, hot damn, it does!

558
00:37:29,102 --> 00:37:32,547
Yes, officer, I'm aware
he's run away in the past, I...

559
00:37:33,090 --> 00:37:34,534
23 times?

560
00:37:35,065 --> 00:37:36,827
Guy's got no social
media presence.

561
00:37:37,312 --> 00:37:38,550
At all.

562
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:40,772
The guy's a ghost.

563
00:38:03,326 --> 00:38:05,207
You know guys,
I'm happy to look for Billy.

564
00:38:05,406 --> 00:38:06,636
More than happy.

565
00:38:06,673 --> 00:38:09,165
Then you gotta wash the dishes,
that's what's more important.

566
00:38:09,356 --> 00:38:11,681
What are you gonna do, Freddy?
Run after him? Ha-ha-ha!

567
00:38:11,759 --> 00:38:13,066
Very funny!

568
00:38:14,862 --> 00:38:16,108
No, wait, don't scream.

569
00:38:16,183 --> 00:38:17,969
Uh, Victor! Victor! Victor!

570
00:38:18,086 --> 00:38:19,776
It's me! It's Billy!
It's Billy!

571
00:38:19,992 --> 00:38:22,185
You asked me,
"Flight or invisibility?"

572
00:38:22,230 --> 00:38:23,999
I thought that was stupid,
but now I look like this

573
00:38:24,030 --> 00:38:25,475
and I need your help!

574
00:38:25,635 --> 00:38:27,421
Meet me back here
after lights out?

575
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:30,676
What's up, bud? You all right?

576
00:38:30,781 --> 00:38:32,535
Yeah. Yeah.

577
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:34,038
I'm just...

578
00:38:34,244 --> 00:38:36,276
I'm really... sad.

579
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:37,776
Because Billy's gone.

580
00:38:37,819 --> 00:38:38,969
And you know,

581
00:38:39,025 --> 00:38:41,119
maybe it's my fault.
Maybe I did it.

582
00:38:41,144 --> 00:38:42,851
Uh, you know, maybe I-I snore.

583
00:38:42,898 --> 00:38:45,816
Hey, hey, hey.
Not your fault, son, all right?

584
00:38:46,489 --> 00:38:48,037
We'll find him, 'kay?

585
00:38:48,881 --> 00:38:50,500
You don't snore that bad.

586
00:38:51,886 --> 00:38:53,290
But you kinda smell.

587
00:39:03,273 --> 00:39:04,828
Oh, oh, oh, my God!

588
00:39:05,225 --> 00:39:07,051
Hey, stop right there.

589
00:39:07,188 --> 00:39:09,837
How do I know you're not a
supervillain using telepathic abilities

590
00:39:09,862 --> 00:39:11,731
to make me believe
that you're Billy, huh?

591
00:39:11,816 --> 00:39:14,031
All I have to do is
press dial on this thing.

592
00:39:14,105 --> 00:39:16,645
No, no, I have proof,
I have proof, here.

593
00:39:17,353 --> 00:39:19,455
Look, I lied, okay?
I took your bullet.

594
00:39:19,503 --> 00:39:22,091
- Oop! No, no, no! No!
- No! No!

595
00:39:22,817 --> 00:39:24,547
Stupid adult hands!

596
00:39:24,657 --> 00:39:26,427
But you saw it.
You saw it, right?

597
00:39:26,533 --> 00:39:29,065
Look, Freddy,
I swear it's me, okay?

598
00:39:29,228 --> 00:39:30,973
Look, I know we're not really
close friends or anything,

599
00:39:30,998 --> 00:39:32,204
but you're the only
person that I know

600
00:39:32,229 --> 00:39:34,275
that knows anything about
this Caped Crusader stuff.

601
00:39:34,341 --> 00:39:36,413
- That's Batman.
- What?

602
00:39:37,082 --> 00:39:38,343
Forget it.

603
00:39:39,771 --> 00:39:40,874
Can I...?

604
00:39:42,583 --> 00:39:43,726
Oh, yeah, yeah.

605
00:39:51,910 --> 00:39:52,957
Oh!

606
00:39:53,108 --> 00:39:54,775
Oh, my God!

607
00:39:55,603 --> 00:39:56,857
It's crazy, right?

608
00:39:57,587 --> 00:39:59,024
What are your superpowers?

609
00:39:59,241 --> 00:40:01,995
Superpowers? Dude, I don't even
know how to pee in this thing!

610
00:40:02,075 --> 00:40:03,853
Okay, c-can you fly?

611
00:40:06,684 --> 00:40:08,083
Okay, let's do this.

612
00:40:08,781 --> 00:40:09,956
How do we do this?

613
00:40:10,247 --> 00:40:12,533
Just, um, just like Superman it.

614
00:40:12,722 --> 00:40:13,826
Pkkwwff.

615
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:16,346
Pkkwf.

616
00:40:16,594 --> 00:40:18,150
Obviously, you have to jump.

617
00:40:18,421 --> 00:40:19,429
Come on.

618
00:40:19,517 --> 00:40:21,088
How is that even obvious?

619
00:40:21,399 --> 00:40:22,455
Okay.

620
00:40:22,868 --> 00:40:25,717
Try, uh, t-to believe
that you can fly.

621
00:40:25,742 --> 00:40:28,690
Okay, I read this deep dive in the
pyramid studies of superpowers

622
00:40:28,723 --> 00:40:31,215
and in 6 out of 10,
belief is the key.

623
00:40:31,507 --> 00:40:33,577
Belief, belief, belief.
Okay, okay.

624
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:35,602
I believe I can fly.
I believe I...

625
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:37,648
I believe I can fly.

626
00:40:38,034 --> 00:40:39,074
I...

627
00:40:47,377 --> 00:40:48,670
Did you believe?

628
00:40:52,175 --> 00:40:53,223
Yeah.

629
00:40:53,477 --> 00:40:54,802
You wanna try invisibility?

630
00:40:56,410 --> 00:40:57,521
How do I do...?

631
00:40:57,592 --> 00:41:00,410
You... Forget it. You know.
Okay, okay, okay.

632
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:06,090
Oh, my God! It worked!

633
00:41:06,487 --> 00:41:07,661
Where'd you go?

634
00:41:09,008 --> 00:41:10,429
I'm right here.
You can't see me?

635
00:41:10,651 --> 00:41:11,802
Where?

636
00:41:12,726 --> 00:41:13,829
I'm invisible!

637
00:41:13,854 --> 00:41:15,543
I'm right here.
I'm over here.

638
00:41:17,449 --> 00:41:18,496
I'm invisible!

639
00:41:18,639 --> 00:41:19,641
I'm invisible!

640
00:41:19,666 --> 00:41:22,079
Hey! Nice outfit, dipshit!

641
00:41:23,837 --> 00:41:24,956
I-I might have

642
00:41:25,036 --> 00:41:28,093
been testing invisibility and super
intelligence at the same time.

643
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:30,540
Freeman, I'm gonna come
over there and beat you.

644
00:41:38,893 --> 00:41:39,894
Oh, my God!

645
00:41:39,949 --> 00:41:42,989
The lightning, it was staring us
right in the face the whole time!

646
00:41:44,193 --> 00:41:45,288
Literally!

647
00:41:53,518 --> 00:41:54,558
Okay, okay.

648
00:41:54,597 --> 00:41:56,595
Billy, we gotta give you a
lightning-themed superhero name.

649
00:41:56,637 --> 00:41:57,685
Yeah.

650
00:42:09,005 --> 00:42:09,878
Oh, right.

651
00:42:09,925 --> 00:42:11,386
Hey, you, back...

652
00:42:13,005 --> 00:42:14,013
off.

653
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:16,081
Hyperspeed, check!

654
00:42:17,761 --> 00:42:19,579
I... I'm sorry-I'm so sorry.

655
00:42:19,604 --> 00:42:21,166
I thought you were the
one who was screaming.

656
00:42:21,215 --> 00:42:22,976
I doused him with pepper spray.

657
00:42:23,567 --> 00:42:24,972
Smart move.

658
00:42:24,997 --> 00:42:26,202
Yeah, hey, get up,
mister mugger guy!

659
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:27,956
Give the old lady
her purse back.

660
00:42:27,981 --> 00:42:29,497
Um, I'm your age.

661
00:42:29,522 --> 00:42:32,285
And he didn't get a chance to take
it 'cause I didn't let him take it.

662
00:42:32,793 --> 00:42:35,357
Good, yeah, good.
You're really on top of this stuff.

663
00:42:35,401 --> 00:42:37,195
And that should teach
you that old ladies,

664
00:42:37,220 --> 00:42:39,196
regular-aged ladies
like yourself

665
00:42:39,221 --> 00:42:40,894
don't need your protecting.

666
00:42:40,979 --> 00:42:42,344
Right? So get off, bro.

667
00:42:42,408 --> 00:42:44,106
I'm sorry, who are you?

668
00:42:44,194 --> 00:42:46,814
His name is Thundercrack!

669
00:42:47,034 --> 00:42:48,446
Hero to the people.

670
00:42:48,510 --> 00:42:50,708
With the power and speed
of lightning all in one.

671
00:42:50,750 --> 00:42:52,377
Dude, that sounds
like a butt thing.

672
00:42:54,135 --> 00:42:56,817
- Mr. Philadelphia!
- That's a cream cheese thing, dude!

673
00:42:56,845 --> 00:42:58,384
Powerboy,
'cause he's got all the powers.

674
00:42:58,409 --> 00:43:01,194
'Cause sometimes pepper spray
can't protect against evil.

675
00:43:01,372 --> 00:43:03,904
Powerboy, do you know this child?

676
00:43:05,458 --> 00:43:07,196
Like, like a teeny little bit.

677
00:43:07,221 --> 00:43:08,293
I don't really know...

678
00:43:08,327 --> 00:43:10,581
Yeah, he's, like, my manager.
He's like a miniature manager.

679
00:43:10,607 --> 00:43:12,353
- I'm his manager.
- And uh, you know.

680
00:43:12,378 --> 00:43:14,894
Powerboy's not gonna work either,
okay? So work on something else...

681
00:43:14,957 --> 00:43:16,497
Hey, hey, hey...

682
00:43:21,443 --> 00:43:24,713
Electricity manipulation,
hyperspeed, super strength!

683
00:43:24,770 --> 00:43:25,897
Dude, you're stacked!

684
00:43:25,971 --> 00:43:28,209
You're as cool as Superman!
Almost.

685
00:43:28,392 --> 00:43:30,344
I didn't see you
or what's happened here.

686
00:43:30,475 --> 00:43:31,975
I don't wanna know.
Just don't hurt me.

687
00:43:32,032 --> 00:43:33,818
- Oh, no, no, I'm not gonna hurt you.
- Thank you for your kind donation.

688
00:43:33,843 --> 00:43:35,232
No, no, no, but if you
need any more help,

689
00:43:35,296 --> 00:43:37,946
just look for the superhero
that still can't fly.

690
00:43:38,325 --> 00:43:41,031
Forget flying, man,
we just made 73 bucks!

691
00:43:41,480 --> 00:43:42,543
73 bucks?

692
00:43:43,067 --> 00:43:44,583
Come on!

693
00:43:45,556 --> 00:43:46,620
Hey, wait a minute.

694
00:43:47,476 --> 00:43:48,834
I just got an idea.

695
00:43:49,707 --> 00:43:52,342
I'd like to purchase some
of your finest beer, please.

696
00:44:11,524 --> 00:44:14,334
I don't know about this.
I mean, we don't have a fake ID.

697
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:16,207
Freddy, would you relax?

698
00:44:16,312 --> 00:44:17,900
Look at me, I am the fake ID.

699
00:44:18,705 --> 00:44:20,769
Everything from the register!
Go! Go!

700
00:44:20,944 --> 00:44:22,550
Now! Come on!

701
00:44:22,575 --> 00:44:24,384
I don't have much time!
Let's go! Move!

702
00:44:24,563 --> 00:44:26,016
I want it all! Hurry!

703
00:44:26,087 --> 00:44:27,230
This is your chance.

704
00:44:27,644 --> 00:44:29,080
Oh! I... okay.

705
00:44:30,566 --> 00:44:32,352
Come on, come on,
let's do this!

706
00:44:36,390 --> 00:44:37,478
Gentlemen!

707
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:40,391
Why use guns when we can
handle this like real men?

708
00:44:42,730 --> 00:44:43,825
Billy, look out!

709
00:44:56,722 --> 00:44:59,508
Bullet immunity.
You have bullet immunity!

710
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:00,829
I'm bulletproof.

711
00:45:02,657 --> 00:45:04,760
Today is December 8th,

712
00:45:04,785 --> 00:45:07,430
and this is video proof
of authenticity.

713
00:45:08,121 --> 00:45:09,192
Shoot him again.

714
00:45:09,304 --> 00:45:10,859
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here, here.

715
00:45:10,907 --> 00:45:12,915
Go, both of you, come on.
Go to town.

716
00:45:19,797 --> 00:45:21,257
W-W-W-Wait!

717
00:45:21,282 --> 00:45:24,473
We still don't know if the suit
is bulletproof or if you are.

718
00:45:26,211 --> 00:45:27,211
Shoot him in the face.

719
00:45:27,236 --> 00:45:28,830
Shoot me in the...
in the face?

720
00:45:36,810 --> 00:45:38,088
It kinda tickles.

721
00:45:39,288 --> 00:45:40,549
You're dead.

722
00:45:46,145 --> 00:45:48,224
- Sorry about your window.
- Have a good night.

723
00:45:48,249 --> 00:45:49,899
But you're welcome
for not getting robbed!

724
00:45:50,155 --> 00:45:51,195
Come on!

725
00:45:51,220 --> 00:45:52,489
Let's get outta here!

726
00:45:53,415 --> 00:45:54,478
Hey.

727
00:45:54,788 --> 00:45:56,193
- To fighting bad guys.
- Yup.

728
00:46:01,684 --> 00:46:03,430
That tastes like actual vomit.

729
00:46:05,163 --> 00:46:06,315
You know,

730
00:46:06,340 --> 00:46:08,313
habanero jerky,
if you eat enough of it,

731
00:46:08,338 --> 00:46:09,964
it could burn a hole
in your stomach.

732
00:46:10,257 --> 00:46:11,812
- Worth it.
- Yeah.

733
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:14,321
Probably not you though.
Probably got stomach superpowers.

734
00:46:14,346 --> 00:46:15,171
Probably.

735
00:46:15,196 --> 00:46:17,108
Oh, hey, what's up?
I'm a superhero.

736
00:46:17,198 --> 00:46:18,722
Yeah, his name is, uh,

737
00:46:18,820 --> 00:46:20,328
Captain Sparkle Fingers.

738
00:46:20,353 --> 00:46:22,565
No it's not. No it's not!
It's not my name!

739
00:46:22,590 --> 00:46:24,522
Hey, we should hang out.
We're like, the same age.

740
00:46:24,627 --> 00:46:26,254
Ho! po-po. I'm out.

741
00:46:26,611 --> 00:46:27,976
Hey, wait up!

742
00:46:34,475 --> 00:46:36,427
I mean, it's a pretty sick view.

743
00:46:37,008 --> 00:46:40,159
I totally get why Rocky was
training so hard to get up here.

744
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:45,074
I like you like this.
This is so cool.

745
00:46:45,848 --> 00:46:47,793
I mean, no offense, but like,

746
00:46:47,824 --> 00:46:50,809
Like, at first, you were kinda
like the opposite of how

747
00:46:50,880 --> 00:46:52,322
of how Darla is.

748
00:46:54,118 --> 00:46:55,229
A dick?

749
00:46:55,317 --> 00:46:57,157
Your words, not mine.

750
00:46:57,395 --> 00:46:58,539
But yeah.

751
00:47:00,478 --> 00:47:02,049
All right, well,
I feel like every criminal

752
00:47:02,074 --> 00:47:03,979
was either on drugs
or asleep by now.

753
00:47:04,427 --> 00:47:05,575
Wanna head home?

754
00:47:06,709 --> 00:47:07,886
Looking like this?

755
00:47:07,957 --> 00:47:09,907
Yeah. I mean,

756
00:47:09,932 --> 00:47:12,526
usually we'd have
a lair to go back to, but

757
00:47:12,692 --> 00:47:13,989
that's long term.

758
00:47:14,501 --> 00:47:16,135
Right now you have a bunk bed.

759
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:23,665
Just scares me thinking of
him out there all alone.

760
00:47:23,888 --> 00:47:25,848
This is what he does, Rosa.

761
00:47:27,163 --> 00:47:29,322
Difference is when
they find him,

762
00:47:29,456 --> 00:47:31,341
we'll be the first
to take him back.

763
00:47:31,763 --> 00:47:33,344
With open arms.

764
00:47:35,513 --> 00:47:38,422
Didn't even make it two days.
Not even two days.

765
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:41,044
Baby, we did our fair share
of running off back then.

766
00:47:41,139 --> 00:47:42,798
At least, I did.

767
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:46,646
Even Mary did it, twice.

768
00:47:48,991 --> 00:47:50,824
That second time she ran off,

769
00:47:50,995 --> 00:47:53,106
you said something
that I'll never forget.

770
00:47:53,769 --> 00:47:54,968
You said,

771
00:47:55,064 --> 00:47:56,993
"It's not a home till
you call it a home.

772
00:47:57,472 --> 00:47:59,080
"It's something you choose."

773
00:48:01,844 --> 00:48:04,860
All we can do is
give him a place full of love.

774
00:48:05,595 --> 00:48:07,588
Whether he chooses
to call it a home,

775
00:48:07,667 --> 00:48:09,071
that's up to him.

776
00:48:14,239 --> 00:48:15,827
Gonna help me with this tree?

777
00:48:17,010 --> 00:48:18,913
This tree's so sad.

778
00:48:20,905 --> 00:48:21,913
H-Hello?

779
00:48:22,291 --> 00:48:24,000
Just got done in the bathroom.

780
00:48:24,405 --> 00:48:26,278
Oh, okay, Freddy,
sweetie, goodnight!

781
00:48:26,516 --> 00:48:27,976
- Night.
- Night.

782
00:48:29,810 --> 00:48:30,981
Freddy, who was that?

783
00:48:31,053 --> 00:48:34,307
It's Billy, he's just really tired
and he has laryngitis.

784
00:48:34,332 --> 00:48:36,283
- What? Laryngitis?
- I'm just kidding! I'm just kidding.

785
00:48:36,308 --> 00:48:38,084
He's really, really tired and he
wants to go beddy bye.

786
00:48:38,151 --> 00:48:40,148
- Beddy bye? What's beddy bye?
- Just hide, hide.

787
00:48:40,173 --> 00:48:41,713
Billy, you're back!
Let us see you!

788
00:48:42,510 --> 00:48:44,463
We're so worried about you.

789
00:48:45,261 --> 00:48:46,912
I told you this was a bad idea!

790
00:48:47,182 --> 00:48:48,428
Freddy?

791
00:48:48,690 --> 00:48:50,420
Hey, what happened
to the stairs?

792
00:48:52,722 --> 00:48:54,295
Hey, covering her mouth
like you're gonna kidnap her

793
00:48:54,320 --> 00:48:56,311
is not gonna make her
less scared, okay?

794
00:48:58,721 --> 00:49:00,348
Darla, it's me, it's Billy.

795
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:02,370
I know I don't look like me.
A wizard made me look like this.

796
00:49:02,395 --> 00:49:03,489
Maybe don't start with wizard,

797
00:49:03,514 --> 00:49:04,781
it's just gonna make
her more confused.

798
00:49:04,806 --> 00:49:06,494
Some old guy brought
me to a temple

799
00:49:06,519 --> 00:49:07,977
and he made me say "Shazam"...

800
00:49:09,545 --> 00:49:10,759
Rosa!

801
00:49:11,250 --> 00:49:13,591
Verbally-triggered body
manipulation properties!

802
00:49:13,616 --> 00:49:15,456
You can switch
by saying "Shazam!"

803
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:19,565
Baby, was that you?
Are you okay?

804
00:49:20,004 --> 00:49:21,051
Um...

805
00:49:21,575 --> 00:49:23,599
I-I was screwing in a bulb.

806
00:49:24,246 --> 00:49:26,961
Listen to me, Darla. You cannot
tell anybody about this, all right?

807
00:49:27,013 --> 00:49:28,965
But it's Billy, he's a hero.

808
00:49:28,990 --> 00:49:30,370
But if a supervillain
finds out that he's a hero,

809
00:49:30,395 --> 00:49:31,935
that endangers us, okay?

810
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:34,707
A hero's loved ones are, like,
a perfect bad guy target.

811
00:49:35,148 --> 00:49:36,775
I-Is she good
at keeping secrets?

812
00:49:36,800 --> 00:49:37,840
Moderate.

813
00:49:38,593 --> 00:49:39,917
- No.
- Oh, God.

814
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:41,380
Okay, listen to me.

815
00:49:41,404 --> 00:49:44,309
You cannot tell a single soul
about this all right? Please.

816
00:49:44,389 --> 00:49:46,627
Why? What if it's
people we trust?

817
00:49:49,827 --> 00:49:51,938
'Cause good sisters
don't tell secrets.

818
00:49:52,115 --> 00:49:54,543
- I'm a good sister.
- Yeah, you are.

819
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:56,172
You know what would make
you an even better sister?

820
00:49:56,197 --> 00:49:58,681
Is when you fix the-
the doorknob for us.

821
00:49:58,706 --> 00:49:59,713
Sweet dreams.

822
00:49:59,794 --> 00:50:00,824
Sweet dreams, goodnight.

823
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:02,055
Good night.

824
00:50:07,578 --> 00:50:09,276
Hello, sir, how may I help you?

825
00:50:09,442 --> 00:50:10,736
Hi, sir.

826
00:50:11,630 --> 00:50:12,916
Sir, you can't go in there.

827
00:50:13,106 --> 00:50:15,036
Excuse me!
You cannot go in there!

828
00:50:20,342 --> 00:50:21,465
Sorry I'm late.

829
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:24,975
Thad, this is for
board members only.

830
00:50:25,072 --> 00:50:26,556
I'm aware of that, Father.

831
00:50:30,089 --> 00:50:31,288
Now...

832
00:50:32,184 --> 00:50:34,907
That night, in the car...

833
00:50:35,394 --> 00:50:37,228
I swore to you
I saw something

834
00:50:37,386 --> 00:50:39,085
but you never believed me.

835
00:50:39,367 --> 00:50:42,407
So much easier to blame
me, wasn't it?

836
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:45,879
And say that if I hadn't
screamed that night,

837
00:50:45,942 --> 00:50:47,426
you'd still have your legs.

838
00:50:48,392 --> 00:50:50,368
Well, now, I have proof.

839
00:50:53,396 --> 00:50:54,958
That's enough, Thad.

840
00:50:54,983 --> 00:50:56,341
Dear Sid.

841
00:50:56,785 --> 00:50:57,991
You think?

842
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:01,903
You know,
even before the accident,

843
00:51:02,007 --> 00:51:03,235
you belittled me.

844
00:51:03,269 --> 00:51:05,754
Don't make me throw you
out of here, Thad.

845
00:51:06,259 --> 00:51:08,338
You don't need to make a scene.

846
00:51:08,572 --> 00:51:09,953
Oh, brother...

847
00:51:10,003 --> 00:51:11,511
The scene

848
00:51:11,590 --> 00:51:13,058
has only just begun.

849
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:18,079
Ask that if you can
throw me out.

850
00:51:18,216 --> 00:51:19,216
What?

851
00:51:19,241 --> 00:51:21,795
Ask the ball if you're man enough
to throw me out of this room.

852
00:51:25,993 --> 00:51:27,422
Let me spoil it for you.

853
00:51:36,076 --> 00:51:37,314
Outlook...

854
00:51:37,885 --> 00:51:39,377
not so good.

855
00:51:41,353 --> 00:51:44,330
I've come here during
the season of giving

856
00:51:44,531 --> 00:51:46,047
to give you...

857
00:51:49,558 --> 00:51:51,256
what you deserve.

858
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,437
Oh, my God!

859
00:52:49,541 --> 00:52:51,692
No! No!

860
00:52:51,986 --> 00:52:53,025
No!

861
00:53:08,001 --> 00:53:09,152
Help!

862
00:53:09,632 --> 00:53:11,243
Somebody!

863
00:53:11,515 --> 00:53:14,023
Help me!

864
00:53:14,430 --> 00:53:16,787
You can't go crying to
other people all the time.

865
00:53:18,357 --> 00:53:21,953
What sin best befits
you, Father? Hmm?

866
00:53:22,081 --> 00:53:23,859
I'll give you anything.

867
00:53:24,155 --> 00:53:25,306
Money...

868
00:53:25,695 --> 00:53:27,687
The company?
You want the company?

869
00:53:28,135 --> 00:53:29,683
There it is.

870
00:53:31,130 --> 00:53:32,320
Greed.

871
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:35,822
Do you honestly think

872
00:53:36,530 --> 00:53:38,404
all this

873
00:53:38,433 --> 00:53:40,544
material you've accumulated

874
00:53:41,957 --> 00:53:44,457
amounts to actual power?

875
00:53:46,607 --> 00:53:49,884
This... is power.

876
00:53:51,089 --> 00:53:53,224
More than you ever had.

877
00:53:53,763 --> 00:53:55,716
More than anyone has.

878
00:53:56,864 --> 00:53:59,872
There is one more powerful.

879
00:54:00,191 --> 00:54:04,565
The wizard found his champion.

880
00:54:04,684 --> 00:54:06,668
Kill the champion

881
00:54:06,724 --> 00:54:10,406
before he learns
his true potential.

882
00:54:10,431 --> 00:54:13,268
Or he will defeat you.

883
00:54:13,518 --> 00:54:15,368
Show me where to find him.

884
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:32,408
Oh, Greed...

885
00:54:33,781 --> 00:54:35,170
you can have him.

886
00:54:36,522 --> 00:54:37,522
No.

887
00:54:39,673 --> 00:54:40,681
No!

888
00:54:41,897 --> 00:54:43,040
No!

889
00:54:44,015 --> 00:54:45,078
No!

890
00:55:02,729 --> 00:55:06,427
<i>Family is more
than just a word.</i>

891
00:55:09,982 --> 00:55:11,173
<i>This is family.</i>

892
00:55:35,090 --> 00:55:37,035
Uh, Burke?

893
00:55:39,422 --> 00:55:40,787
Where's the truck?

894
00:55:50,083 --> 00:55:51,385
I can hear it.

895
00:56:01,207 --> 00:56:04,310
- Oh, my God!
- My truck!

896
00:56:04,845 --> 00:56:06,905
- My truck!
- Are you kidding?

897
00:56:07,436 --> 00:56:08,603
You know, guys...

898
00:56:09,261 --> 00:56:10,904
I don't think that's
gonna buff out.

899
00:56:20,735 --> 00:56:23,378
Making the cripple kid
do the dirty work, wow.

900
00:56:23,444 --> 00:56:25,689
I'm a better lookout.
I can play innocent.

901
00:56:25,714 --> 00:56:27,031
And I can't?

902
00:56:28,122 --> 00:56:29,899
Your face gives off
a very strong vibe

903
00:56:29,924 --> 00:56:31,614
of someone who's
hatching schemes.

904
00:56:31,808 --> 00:56:34,403
- M-My face? This face?
- Yeah!

905
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,666
Okay.

906
00:56:41,448 --> 00:56:42,956
You boys got a hall pass?

907
00:56:43,503 --> 00:56:45,765
Oh, us? Yeah. Always.

908
00:56:46,448 --> 00:56:47,575
You.

909
00:56:50,500 --> 00:56:51,984
You look like
you're up to somethin'.

910
00:56:52,072 --> 00:56:54,469
Me? Up to something?
No. Never.

911
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:55,718
I'm not up to something.

912
00:56:55,774 --> 00:56:57,353
Our dad's picking us up.

913
00:56:57,432 --> 00:56:59,954
He, uh, he got held up at the...
the business

914
00:56:59,979 --> 00:57:00,988
office.

915
00:57:01,013 --> 00:57:02,789
The business office, huh?

916
00:57:02,913 --> 00:57:04,000
Sure, kid.

917
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:05,104
Look.

918
00:57:05,129 --> 00:57:08,739
Parents or guardians
must appear physically

919
00:57:08,764 --> 00:57:10,430
to check out students.

920
00:57:10,455 --> 00:57:11,756
Gotcha.

921
00:57:11,923 --> 00:57:13,836
Okay, well, uh,
you hear that, Dad?

922
00:57:14,244 --> 00:57:15,387
- Hey.
- Shazam!

923
00:57:15,908 --> 00:57:17,400
Oh, hey, there, son!

924
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:19,702
Oh, hey, there, other son
that I also have that's related

925
00:57:19,734 --> 00:57:21,471
to that son I just
passed in the hallway.

926
00:57:21,550 --> 00:57:24,171
I'm so sorry I'm late,
I got held up

927
00:57:24,196 --> 00:57:26,359
at the business office.

928
00:57:26,518 --> 00:57:27,820
Doing all the work stuff.

929
00:57:27,891 --> 00:57:31,786
This is the-the security guard
all the kids admire so much.

930
00:57:31,826 --> 00:57:32,835
Oh.

931
00:57:32,891 --> 00:57:34,531
That's the other one.
This one sucks.

932
00:57:34,753 --> 00:57:36,944
This is... that's not funny.

933
00:57:37,019 --> 00:57:40,130
I gotta talk to him about that.
I apologize.

934
00:57:40,155 --> 00:57:41,711
Anyway, this is me
appearing physically

935
00:57:41,736 --> 00:57:43,370
to check my sons out of school.

936
00:57:43,395 --> 00:57:45,314
So, thank you so much
for keeping them safe,

937
00:57:45,430 --> 00:57:47,494

seas below it.

- Like waterfall, so you can, like...

Waterfall! Yeah,

bedrooms you're looking for?

1051
01:01:54,767 --> 01:01:55,838
- One.
- Seven.

1052
01:01:55,863 --> 01:01:56,902
- One?
- Seven?

1053
01:01:56,927 --> 01:01:59,154
What? Am I runnin'

the football into space?

1056
01:02:13,587 --> 01:02:15,538
Hey, you know, you guys gotta
wonder who's filming those, right?

1057
01:02:15,563 --> 01:02:17,309
I mean, that's bravery
in and of itself.

1058
01:02:18,001 --> 01:02:19,247
I mean, is it though?

1059
01:02:19,272 --> 01:02:21,575
Yeah. I'd actually argue
maybe even more brave.

1060
01:02:21,746 --> 01:02:23,040
Holding a camera?

1061

Staring in the face of danger.

us with a wheelchair this time?

1066

have another best friend.

1067
01:02:36,757 --> 01:02:38,710
Who might hunt you down
and destroy both of you.

1068
01:02:39,331 --> 01:02:41,268
- Okay, Freddy.
- You may have heard of him.

Uh, uh, the Human Powerstorm.

Sir-Zaps-A-Lot.

01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,711
Yeah, he's a man of many names.

1072
01:02:47,817 --> 01:02:49,896
You know the Red Cyclone?
You?

1073
01:02:49,959 --> 01:02:51,668
Huh. My ass, you do.

1074
01:02:51,748 --> 01:02:53,652
Oh, we're a lot
closer than you think.

1075
01:02:53,830 --> 01:02:55,568
Maybe even at this very moment.

1076
01:02:55,890 --> 01:02:56,922
Prove it.

1077
01:02:56,947 --> 01:03:00,048
I will tomorrow. Tomorrow
he's gonna come to lunch and...

1078
01:03:00,112 --> 01:03:01,288
R-Right, Billy?

1079
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:02,458
Oh, yeah, and then Superman's

1080
01:03:02,483 --> 01:03:04,561
gonna be bringing us
dessert, right?

1081
01:03:07,079 --> 01:03:09,102
Tomorrow, at lunch.
You'll see.

1082
01:03:09,171 --> 01:03:11,242
And when he doesn't show, then

1083
01:03:11,274 --> 01:03:12,655
we'll kick your ass.

1084
01:03:15,383 --> 01:03:16,891
So wait, my identity's a secret

1085
01:03:16,916 --> 01:03:18,724
so no one I know can get hurt.

1086
01:03:19,148 --> 01:03:20,765
Except when it makes
you look cool, then

1087
01:03:20,790 --> 01:03:22,188
then it's all good.

1088
01:03:22,213 --> 01:03:23,730
Billy, it's not like
they're supervillains

1089
01:03:23,755 --> 01:03:25,048
they're just super douchebags.

1090
01:03:25,765 --> 01:03:27,773
So you're breaking your own rule?

1091
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:29,229
Got it.

1092
01:03:29,882 --> 01:03:32,390
This thing is as much as
mine as it is yours.

1093
01:03:33,743 --> 01:03:35,664
I'm starting to think you
think it's all your thing.

1094
01:03:36,182 --> 01:03:37,968
Billy, you're still gonna
do it, though, right?

1095
01:03:38,602 --> 01:03:40,454
I mean, what would
a good brother do?

1096
01:03:42,459 --> 01:03:43,855
All hands on deck!

1097
01:03:47,417 --> 01:03:50,171
Thank you for this family.
Thank you for this day.

1098
01:03:50,229 --> 01:03:51,801
Thank you for this food.

1099
01:03:51,856 --> 01:03:53,952
Sorry Billy's hand's on vacay.

1100
01:03:57,765 --> 01:04:00,479
Big news in Philly.
They found a costumed hero.

1101
01:04:00,997 --> 01:04:02,235
He's doing good.

1102
01:04:02,471 --> 01:04:04,098
Yeah, but is he, though?

1103
01:04:04,367 --> 01:04:06,384
Oooh, controversy.

1104
01:04:06,409 --> 01:04:07,418
Into it.

1105
01:04:07,443 --> 01:04:10,265
Share with us your
perspective, Eugene.

1106
01:04:10,658 --> 01:04:13,627
Just saying, he's what?
Charging people's phones?

1107
01:04:13,701 --> 01:04:16,780
So what? I can charge a phone...
with a plug.

1108
01:04:16,814 --> 01:04:18,060
Preach.

1109
01:04:18,310 --> 01:04:20,532
Pedro, any thoughts?

1110
01:04:21,099 --> 01:04:22,535
Costume's stupid?

1111
01:04:24,180 --> 01:04:26,696
Big white cape like, he's
getting married or something.

1112
01:04:26,904 --> 01:04:28,984
What if he didn't get
to pick his costume?

1113
01:04:29,055 --> 01:04:30,889
Ever think about that?

1114
01:04:31,339 --> 01:04:33,260
You're a specialist, Freddy.
What do you think?

1115
01:04:33,348 --> 01:04:34,935
Yeah, Freddy, let's

1116
01:04:35,071 --> 01:04:36,769
manage to see the positive.

1117
01:04:36,955 --> 01:04:39,067
Okay, well, I think
it looks like

1118
01:04:39,179 --> 01:04:41,274
he doesn't have gratitude
for what he's been given.

1119
01:04:41,568 --> 01:04:43,941
Very specific. All right.

1120
01:04:44,009 --> 01:04:45,168
Maybe to this superhero,

1121
01:04:45,193 --> 01:04:47,200
gratitude doesn't mean
having to be clingy.

1122
01:04:47,296 --> 01:04:48,788
"Clingy", wow, interesting take.

1123
01:04:48,865 --> 01:04:51,166
You know, maybe sometimes
a superhero just

1124
01:04:51,191 --> 01:04:52,739
wants a little me time.

1125
01:04:52,764 --> 01:04:54,862
You know, me time can
also be construed as

1126
01:04:54,887 --> 01:04:56,108
pushing away his family.

1127
01:04:56,133 --> 01:04:58,246
Family. Is that
what they are now?

1128
01:04:58,327 --> 01:05:00,097
It's a classic symptom of
superhero syndrome

1129
01:05:00,127 --> 01:05:02,373
coined by German psychologist

1130
01:05:02,398 --> 01:05:04,334
Heinrich de Von...
German something, where

1131
01:05:04,397 --> 01:05:06,980
superpowers become an
all-consuming narcotic.

1132
01:05:08,697 --> 01:05:10,483
Son, we're still eating dinner.

1133
01:05:10,534 --> 01:05:12,113
What he needs is a sidekick.

1134
01:05:12,161 --> 01:05:14,216
Name one cool sidekick.

1135
01:05:14,906 --> 01:05:17,375
Darla, why are you so
quiet over there, baby?

1136
01:05:17,525 --> 01:05:19,310
You're never
at a loss for words.

1137
01:05:19,613 --> 01:05:21,121
I'm eating.

1138
01:05:32,127 --> 01:05:33,706
Why am I still doing this?

1139
01:05:34,558 --> 01:05:36,272
Billy, you can't skip every day.

1140
01:05:36,368 --> 01:05:37,574
Not at your age.

1141
01:05:38,631 --> 01:05:39,933
I'm not your age anymore.

1142
01:05:40,936 --> 01:05:42,857
But I can go with you,
we just gotta

1143
01:05:42,922 --> 01:05:44,740
trick the guard out,
you know, and then...

1144
01:05:44,803 --> 01:05:46,629
Billy, where are you going?

1145
01:05:46,800 --> 01:05:48,411
You're still gonna have
lunch with me, right?

1146
01:05:48,550 --> 01:05:49,709
Billy?

1147
01:05:49,859 --> 01:05:52,836
Sir-Zaps-A-Lot's still gonna
eat in the cafeteria, right?

1148
01:05:58,987 --> 01:06:00,370
<i>♪ Here we go now ♪</i>

1149
01:06:00,395 --> 01:06:01,656
<i>♪ Holla if ya hear me though ♪</i>

1150
01:06:01,681 --> 01:06:02,894
<i>♪ Come and feel me flow ♪</i>

1151
01:06:02,919 --> 01:06:04,379
All right!

1152
01:06:04,428 --> 01:06:05,944
Did you check it?

1153
01:06:06,405 --> 01:06:09,992
People typically, like, give me
a little money, you know, to...

1154
01:06:10,140 --> 01:06:12,410
You're a sweet couple,
you guys have a good day.

1155
01:06:24,184 --> 01:06:25,422
Oh, my God.

1156
01:06:25,447 --> 01:06:27,224
Mary, Mary, are you okay?

1157
01:06:27,408 --> 01:06:28,558
How do you know my name?

1158
01:06:28,583 --> 01:06:31,114
Uh, how do I know
your name, uh...

1159
01:06:31,265 --> 01:06:33,726
Uh, one of my superpowers
is name-guessing.

1160
01:06:34,142 --> 01:06:35,976
Which is really weird, I bet.

1161
01:06:36,001 --> 01:06:38,303
Uh, it's not as cool as super
strength or super speed

1162
01:06:38,328 --> 01:06:40,868
but it's really helpful
when I meet new people.

1163
01:06:41,675 --> 01:06:43,008
Are you hurt?

1164
01:06:43,183 --> 01:06:45,580
No, I'm... I'm okay.

1165
01:06:45,611 --> 01:06:47,159
Thank you, um...

1166
01:06:48,891 --> 01:06:50,661
I just need a second to think.

1167
01:06:51,364 --> 01:06:52,801
This has been such
a weird day.

1168
01:06:52,907 --> 01:06:57,057
Um, using my powers
of super observation,

1169
01:06:57,082 --> 01:06:59,992
I see that you're holding
a letter from a college

1170
01:07:00,055 --> 01:07:03,397
in your hand. Are you upset
because you didn't get in?

1171
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,358
I got in.

1172
01:07:10,433 --> 01:07:12,894
Uh... well, now my
superpowers are failing me

1173
01:07:12,957 --> 01:07:14,715
and I'm very confused.

1174
01:07:15,700 --> 01:07:17,446
Yeah, me too.

1175
01:07:18,395 --> 01:07:20,903
I don't know. I know I should be
excited 'cause this is my dream

1176
01:07:20,928 --> 01:07:23,204
and I worked really,
really hard for this.

1177
01:07:24,026 --> 01:07:25,352
But it's like...

1178
01:07:27,968 --> 01:07:30,619
I don't know, leaving my family
does not feel fun, you know?

1179
01:07:30,709 --> 01:07:33,375
Can I-Can I-Can I give you
a little piece of advice?

1180
01:07:33,681 --> 01:07:35,481
Don't be worried about
everybody else.

1181
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:37,307
Always look out for number one.

1182
01:07:37,397 --> 01:07:39,564
- Gandhi said that.
- I don't think he said that.

1183
01:07:39,625 --> 01:07:41,433
- Yeah, he did.
- Gandhi did not say that.

1184
01:07:41,458 --> 01:07:43,196
- Somebody like Gandhi said that.
- Take care of number one?

1185
01:07:43,236 --> 01:07:45,403
It was a really wi...
It might have been Yoda.

1186
01:07:45,433 --> 01:07:46,679
- Listen.
- I'm sorry, no.

1187
01:07:46,704 --> 01:07:48,592
Agree to disagree.
The point is...

1188
01:07:48,647 --> 01:07:50,973
You do you, you know?
You gotta look out for you.

1189
01:07:51,023 --> 01:07:53,594
And get as far away from
this place as you can.

1190
01:07:55,473 --> 01:07:56,950
I don't know if I want to.

1191
01:07:56,975 --> 01:07:58,562
Of course you do.
What are you gonna do?

1192
01:07:58,587 --> 01:08:00,688
You're gonna live in a group
home for the rest of your life?

1193
01:08:02,386 --> 01:08:04,616
Look, families are for people who
can't take care of themselves.

1194
01:08:04,641 --> 01:08:06,601
Okay? So.

1195
01:08:07,450 --> 01:08:09,758
And you know, y-you can take
care of yourself, you know.

1196
01:08:09,783 --> 01:08:11,759
Also, look both ways
when you cross the street.

1197
01:08:16,709 --> 01:08:18,201
I'll just call him.

1198
01:08:22,158 --> 01:08:23,333
It's ringing.

1199
01:08:25,812 --> 01:08:27,804
Red Cyclone! Hey!
Hey, what's goin' on?

1200
01:08:28,680 --> 01:08:30,442
Oh, that's crazy.
Yeah, it's Freddy, by the way.

1201
01:08:30,467 --> 01:08:31,799
Yeah, it's crazy.
That is...

1202
01:08:31,824 --> 01:08:33,037
Great story.

1203
01:08:34,016 --> 01:08:35,278
He's not talking.

1204
01:08:36,979 --> 01:08:38,669
I was! I was!

1205
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,371
We're friends.
I know him. I do.

1206
01:08:40,474 --> 01:08:41,720
I know... I know...

1207
01:08:46,370 --> 01:08:47,402
Shit.

1208
01:08:51,699 --> 01:08:52,873
Come on, now.

1209
01:08:53,096 --> 01:08:56,088
♪ Hands. Lightning with my hands. ♪

1210
01:08:56,320 --> 01:08:57,939
♪ Lightning with my hands. ♪

1211
01:08:58,420 --> 01:09:00,618
♪ Lightning with my hands. ♪

1212
01:09:00,643 --> 01:09:02,478
Hey! Hey!

1213
01:09:02,542 --> 01:09:03,820
Hey, young man.

1214
01:09:03,853 --> 01:09:05,010
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1215
01:09:05,035 --> 01:09:06,633
I'm in the middle
of a show right now.

1216
01:09:06,660 --> 01:09:07,945
How can I help you?

1217
01:09:07,970 --> 01:09:10,699
I just wanna say thank you
for showing up to lunch today.

1218
01:09:10,964 --> 01:09:14,225
Yeah, I got a little something
called a suitcase wedgie, right?

1219
01:09:14,250 --> 01:09:15,924
I don't know if you've ever
heard of it, but it's when

1220
01:09:15,949 --> 01:09:17,960
someone grabs your
underwear like that

1221
01:09:17,985 --> 01:09:19,191
and hold you like a suitcase,

1222
01:09:19,216 --> 01:09:20,806
walks you down the hallway.

1223
01:09:21,031 --> 01:09:23,301
And this was my underwear.

1224
01:09:26,010 --> 01:09:27,168
Gross.

1225
01:09:27,567 --> 01:09:28,776
You said you'd come.

1226
01:09:28,801 --> 01:09:30,837
You said I will come,
I never said I was...

1227
01:09:31,127 --> 01:09:32,667
I'm a superhero, dude.

1228
01:09:32,730 --> 01:09:34,198
Well, you're acting real heroic.

1229
01:09:34,421 --> 01:09:35,992
How much are people
paying you today?

1230
01:09:36,994 --> 01:09:40,311
Listen, I have serious
responsibilities now, okay?

1231
01:09:40,383 --> 01:09:42,645
But that's cool because I can
carry that burden with my...

1232
01:09:42,670 --> 01:09:45,292
♪ hands. Lightning with my hands. ♪

1233
01:10:11,381 --> 01:10:12,659
Holy moley.

1234
01:10:14,826 --> 01:10:16,175
Don't move!

1235
01:10:16,200 --> 01:10:17,689
Nobody move!

1236
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:27,469
Oh, no.

1237
01:10:27,699 --> 01:10:29,295
No, no, no, no, no.
Stay, stay.

1238
01:10:29,398 --> 01:10:31,225
Stay. Stay. Stay.

1239
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:40,625
Oh.

1240
01:10:41,046 --> 01:10:42,569
Oh, that looked like it hurts.

1241
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:43,970
It's him!

1242
01:10:44,042 --> 01:10:45,708
It's the superhero guy!

1243
01:10:46,554 --> 01:10:47,721
Save us!

1244
01:10:48,562 --> 01:10:49,697
Come on.

1245
01:10:51,608 --> 01:10:52,750
Come...

1246
01:10:54,530 --> 01:10:56,601
What's he doing?
What's going on?

1247
01:11:05,740 --> 01:11:06,748
What?

1248
01:11:14,237 --> 01:11:16,483
Oh, no. Oh, no, no.
Please don't make me do this.

1249
01:11:16,813 --> 01:11:18,511
That is the worst idea ever!

1250
01:11:28,290 --> 01:11:30,886
Oho! Oh, I did it!

1251
01:11:30,927 --> 01:11:32,086
I did it!

1252
01:11:32,150 --> 01:11:34,277
I got the bus!
I got the bus.

1253
01:11:34,471 --> 01:11:35,693
Nobody move in there!

1254
01:11:35,996 --> 01:11:37,925
I gotta put this thing down,
I gotta put this thing down.

1255
01:11:43,911 --> 01:11:46,619
No, no, no, doggie, doggie,
you have to move. Move!

1256
01:11:46,644 --> 01:11:47,794
Shoo! Shoo!

1257
01:11:47,819 --> 01:11:49,651
Please be a good dog.
Good dog!

1258
01:11:49,676 --> 01:11:51,233
Ooh, you're being a bad dog.

1259
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:52,687
Go! Go!

1260
01:11:53,509 --> 01:11:55,080
Please go. Please move.

1261
01:11:56,021 --> 01:11:57,910
Yes, thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

1262
01:11:58,441 --> 01:11:59,560
Thank you.

1263
01:12:15,593 --> 01:12:16,617
Yeah.

1264
01:12:16,814 --> 01:12:18,759
Yeah, no, no, no, my f...

1265
01:12:18,791 --> 01:12:20,920
I was in the neighborhood,
you know, so I thought...

1266
01:12:20,945 --> 01:12:22,024
Thank you, thank you.

1267
01:12:22,049 --> 01:12:24,119
You know, it's kinda
my fault, anyway.

1268
01:12:26,912 --> 01:12:30,475
So, it seems Philadelphia has
gotten an early Christmas present

1269
01:12:30,509 --> 01:12:34,353
in the form of
its very own superhero.

1270
01:12:34,420 --> 01:12:35,896
And we're out.

1271
01:12:36,261 --> 01:12:38,134
- Hey, thank you very much.
- Oh, of course, yeah.

1272
01:12:38,159 --> 01:12:40,501
Dude! Dude, dude!
Dude, did you see that?

1273
01:12:40,734 --> 01:12:43,925
Yeah, you electrocuted a bus
and almost killed these people.

1274
01:12:44,103 --> 01:12:45,888
And then I caught it!

1275
01:12:46,139 --> 01:12:49,544
Freddy! I caught a bus
with my bare hands, man!

1276
01:12:49,569 --> 01:12:51,897
I caught a bus like people
catch fly balls, like...

1277
01:12:51,921 --> 01:12:53,190
Who does that? I do that.

1278
01:12:53,215 --> 01:12:54,875
Billy, you do nothing, you...

1279
01:12:54,947 --> 01:12:57,582
you take selfies and
make people pay you.

1280
01:12:57,746 --> 01:12:58,769
You know what, forget it.

1281
01:12:58,794 --> 01:13:01,080
I can't really talk to you
when you look like this.

1282
01:13:01,326 --> 01:13:02,683
You just wish it was you.

1283
01:13:03,584 --> 01:13:04,727
No shit.

1284
01:13:05,332 --> 01:13:06,379
You think?

1285
01:13:06,404 --> 01:13:08,467
I would kill to have
what you have.

1286
01:13:09,075 --> 01:13:10,638
'Cause everything I do

1287
01:13:10,702 --> 01:13:12,377
is like, some-some
desperate attempt

1288
01:13:12,417 --> 01:13:14,178
to get people to notice me.

1289
01:13:14,350 --> 01:13:15,794
To not feel sorry for me.

1290
01:13:16,114 --> 01:13:17,589
I mean, look at me.
Look at me.

1291
01:13:17,614 --> 01:13:19,045
Do you even see me?

1292
01:13:19,466 --> 01:13:21,117
'Cause most people don't.

1293
01:13:21,945 --> 01:13:23,310
'Cause they don't want to.

1294
01:13:24,107 --> 01:13:25,433
And you don't either.

1295
01:13:26,412 --> 01:13:28,102
I mean, you think
this is who you are?

1296
01:13:28,667 --> 01:13:30,229
I mean, Billy, you're 14.

1297
01:13:30,254 --> 01:13:32,040
And now you're no
better than the Breyers.

1298
01:13:32,677 --> 01:13:34,354
All this power,

1299
01:13:34,401 --> 01:13:37,369
and all you did was turn
into a showoff and a bully.

1300
01:13:39,921 --> 01:13:41,048
Whatever, kid.

1301
01:13:41,136 --> 01:13:42,556
I do what I want!

1302
01:13:44,328 --> 01:13:46,629
And I'm like mid-20s, probably.

1303
01:13:47,704 --> 01:13:49,251
Maybe even, like, 30.

1304
01:13:52,994 --> 01:13:54,359
Chosen one.

1305
01:13:57,873 --> 01:13:59,960
The so-called perfect man.

1306
01:14:01,425 --> 01:14:02,726
Pure of heart.

1307
01:14:03,948 --> 01:14:05,774
Flawless in every way.

1308
01:14:08,351 --> 01:14:09,994
What made you so worthy?

1309
01:14:10,108 --> 01:14:12,092
I'm sorry, can I help...
can I help...?

1310
01:14:12,211 --> 01:14:13,719
D'you want a autograph
or somethin'?

1311
01:14:13,744 --> 01:14:15,078
Give me your power.

1312
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:18,917
Or die.

1313
01:14:18,965 --> 01:14:20,473
Oh, snap.

1314
01:14:21,144 --> 01:14:22,541
You're like a bad guy, right?

1315
01:14:22,583 --> 01:14:23,597
Okay, okay, okay, okay.

1316
01:14:23,622 --> 01:14:25,638
Look, before this gets
really stupid for you,

1317
01:14:25,718 --> 01:14:27,694
you should know that
I'm basically invincible.

1318
01:14:36,565 --> 01:14:39,361
The weapons of man draw
no blood from our kind.

1319
01:14:39,386 --> 01:14:40,406
This is the...

1320
01:14:41,585 --> 01:14:44,696
The only thing that
extinguishes magic

1321
01:14:44,800 --> 01:14:46,165
is magic.

1322
01:14:47,462 --> 01:14:49,677
Time to transfer
your power to me.

1323
01:14:52,519 --> 01:14:56,011
Oho, you did not see that one
coming, did you, grandpa?

1324
01:14:56,196 --> 01:14:57,664
Them's street rules!

1325
01:15:07,335 --> 01:15:08,652
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay!

1326
01:15:08,677 --> 01:15:10,643
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

1327
01:15:10,680 --> 01:15:12,380
I never should've punched
you in the nuts like that.

1328
01:15:12,405 --> 01:15:13,628
That was totally my bad.

1329
01:15:13,692 --> 01:15:15,001
We can talk about this.

1330
01:15:15,129 --> 01:15:16,502
You grovel like a child.

1331
01:15:16,537 --> 01:15:18,798
That's because I am one.
I-I'm a kid.

1332
01:15:18,823 --> 01:15:20,267
You don't want to
hurt a kid, do you?

1333
01:15:23,276 --> 01:15:24,395
I believe I can fly!

1334
01:15:24,420 --> 01:15:26,041
I believe I can fly!
I can fly!

1335
01:15:26,066 --> 01:15:27,475
Freddy said if I believe,
I can fly!

1336
01:15:27,500 --> 01:15:29,055
Then I can fly, so I believe!

1337
01:15:29,144 --> 01:15:30,374
I believe, oh, please!

1338
01:15:30,424 --> 01:15:31,956
Okay! Superman!

1339
01:15:31,981 --> 01:15:34,384
Superman!
What arm is it?!

1340
01:15:34,454 --> 01:15:35,946
Why am I not flying?!

1341
01:15:35,971 --> 01:15:37,834
Please, I don't wanna die!

1342
01:15:54,045 --> 01:15:55,069
Oh.

1343
01:15:57,022 --> 01:15:58,069
Whoa.

1344
01:15:58,365 --> 01:15:59,444
Whoa.

1345
01:16:00,079 --> 01:16:01,698
I'm floating!

1346
01:16:15,016 --> 01:16:16,389
I can fly!

1347
01:16:22,438 --> 01:16:23,580
Billy?

1348
01:16:24,926 --> 01:16:26,711
Freddy! I need your help!

1349
01:16:26,886 --> 01:16:28,164
You can fly?

1350
01:16:36,357 --> 01:16:37,682
Who's the other guy?

1351
01:16:37,986 --> 01:16:39,406
Santa!

1352
01:16:42,265 --> 01:16:46,053
So, like, what you and Mrs.
Claus do in the summertime?

1353
01:16:46,249 --> 01:16:48,710
Well, in some ways,

1354
01:16:48,853 --> 01:16:50,726
Santa's always here for you.

1355
01:16:55,571 --> 01:16:56,674
Oh, help!

1356
01:16:57,865 --> 01:16:59,238
Help Santa!

1357
01:16:59,567 --> 01:17:01,464
Santa needs help!

1358
01:17:02,119 --> 01:17:03,484
Give us a shout if you need us.

1359
01:17:10,310 --> 01:17:13,342
I'm just gonna chill in here for
a little while, if that's okay.

1360
01:17:16,729 --> 01:17:17,856
This is crazy!

1361
01:17:18,175 --> 01:17:19,723
This is crazy. You don't
have to fight this guy.

1362
01:17:19,748 --> 01:17:21,794
This isn't your job.
You can run, right?

1363
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:24,354
Yes! You can run. Awesome.

1364
01:17:32,713 --> 01:17:33,935
Get back!

1365
01:17:33,999 --> 01:17:35,689
Just get... Get away!

1366
01:17:37,646 --> 01:17:39,725
<i>I'm Batman.</i>
Get him, Batman!

1367
01:18:09,781 --> 01:18:10,948
Come on!

1368
01:18:36,466 --> 01:18:38,418
Sh... Shazam!

1369
01:19:08,394 --> 01:19:09,585
Billy!

1370
01:19:10,541 --> 01:19:11,795
Billy!

1371
01:19:13,359 --> 01:19:14,605
Billy, where are you?

1372
01:19:17,897 --> 01:19:18,952
Billy!

1373
01:19:20,190 --> 01:19:21,468
Where are you, Billy?

1374
01:19:25,936 --> 01:19:27,079
Billy, come on!

1375
01:19:30,102 --> 01:19:31,205
Billy.

1376
01:19:32,096 --> 01:19:34,326
- Where is he?
- Um, supervillain.

1377
01:19:34,797 --> 01:19:37,043
Supervillain! Supervillain!

1378
01:19:38,176 --> 01:19:39,350
Worse.

1379
01:19:39,763 --> 01:19:40,993
Much worse.

1380
01:19:41,243 --> 01:19:42,608
Radioactive anthromorph.

1381
01:19:42,648 --> 01:19:44,457
Psychic energy manipulator.

1382
01:19:44,753 --> 01:19:46,006
I won't let you read my mind.

1383
01:19:46,031 --> 01:19:48,158
My mind is blank.
You can't get in.

1384
01:19:48,183 --> 01:19:49,812
I don't need to read your mind.

1385
01:19:50,385 --> 01:19:52,362
Because you are going to tell me.

1386
01:19:52,975 --> 01:19:54,356
Where is he?

1387
01:20:06,696 --> 01:20:08,038
Oh, my God, are you okay?

1388
01:20:09,276 --> 01:20:10,284
You okay?

1389
01:20:10,807 --> 01:20:12,132
What happened?
Are you hurt?

1390
01:20:12,230 --> 01:20:13,381
Come inside.

1391
01:20:13,492 --> 01:20:14,666
We need to have a talk.

1392
01:20:16,115 --> 01:20:17,750
Just don't be too
hard on him, okay?

1393
01:20:24,206 --> 01:20:26,754
Running out on us.
Lying.

1394
01:20:26,910 --> 01:20:28,322
Then I get a call
from the school

1395
01:20:28,347 --> 01:20:30,267
telling me you've
been cutting class.

1396
01:20:30,524 --> 01:20:31,801
Getting in fights.

1397
01:20:38,085 --> 01:20:40,021
Whoa, is that...?

1398
01:20:42,341 --> 01:20:44,611
What's Freddy doing
with a superhero?

1399
01:20:47,939 --> 01:20:51,162
What's this superhero
doing with Freddy?

1400
01:20:54,635 --> 01:20:56,040
You remember dinner?

1401
01:20:56,065 --> 01:20:58,096
When Billy and
Freddy were arguing

1402
01:20:58,163 --> 01:20:59,893
like an old married
couple like this?

1403
01:21:01,230 --> 01:21:03,904
When he rescued me, he
knew I lived in a group home.

1404
01:21:03,936 --> 01:21:05,992
He knew my name.
He called me Mary.

1405
01:21:14,481 --> 01:21:15,560
Wait.

1406
01:21:15,585 --> 01:21:17,989
Are you saying Billy's
the Human Powerstorm?

1407
01:21:18,039 --> 01:21:19,864
Yes! You guys figured it out!

1408
01:21:19,938 --> 01:21:21,532
All on your own.
I didn't help.

1409
01:21:21,557 --> 01:21:22,835
I didn't break any promises.

1410
01:21:22,860 --> 01:21:24,030
You knew?

1411
01:21:24,110 --> 01:21:25,705
I'm a good sister!

1412
01:21:29,911 --> 01:21:31,308
I mean, what were you thinking?

1413
01:21:32,530 --> 01:21:34,110
Then you bring Freddy into it.

1414
01:21:40,129 --> 01:21:43,042
Give him some space, guys.
He's a little upset. Okay?

1415
01:21:53,155 --> 01:21:54,234
Billy?

1416
01:21:59,337 --> 01:22:00,655
You're him.

1417
01:22:01,718 --> 01:22:03,147
You're the hero.

1418
01:22:04,310 --> 01:22:06,691
Yeah, well, not anymore, so.

1419
01:22:10,806 --> 01:22:12,647
Why do you have my notebook?

1420
01:22:15,480 --> 01:22:17,345
Eugene finished you search.

1421
01:22:18,008 --> 01:22:20,214
Look, I'm not a hacker, okay?

1422
01:22:20,447 --> 01:22:22,891
But I have played
Watchdogs and Uplink.

1423
01:22:22,957 --> 01:22:25,091
And maybe I did
pick up a few skills

1424
01:22:25,124 --> 01:22:27,204
which maybe did get me
into federal databases

1425
01:22:27,229 --> 01:22:28,450
most people can't get into, but...

1426
01:22:28,517 --> 01:22:30,295
Good for you,
but I'm gonna go.

1427
01:22:30,671 --> 01:22:33,853
Your parents' names
are Marilyn and C.C. Batson.

1428
01:22:39,373 --> 01:22:40,460
What?

1429
01:22:40,628 --> 01:22:42,573
You were born in
Zumbrota, Minnesota.

1430
01:22:42,869 --> 01:22:44,544
They divorced when
you were three.

1431
01:22:44,792 --> 01:22:46,229
Your mom moved here that year.

1432
01:22:46,476 --> 01:22:48,254
20 months later, you got lost.

1433
01:22:49,085 --> 01:22:51,537
You never found them 'cause
your dad's been in prison

1434
01:22:51,562 --> 01:22:53,085
in Florida for 10 years.

1435
01:22:53,286 --> 01:22:54,643
And your mom's...

1436
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:57,471
What?

1437
01:22:59,027 --> 01:23:00,114
Is she dead?

1438
01:23:00,729 --> 01:23:02,857
She's two subway stops away.

1439
01:23:03,841 --> 01:23:04,865
What?

1440
01:23:05,876 --> 01:23:06,883
You know, you didn't find her

1441
01:23:06,908 --> 01:23:09,179
because she reverted
to her maiden name.

1442
01:23:13,439 --> 01:23:15,836
Hey, Billy! Billy!

1443
01:23:19,048 --> 01:23:20,484
Victor, get the keys.

1444
01:23:20,509 --> 01:23:22,683
Kids, stay here,
in case Billy comes back.

1445
01:23:30,945 --> 01:23:32,611
Get inside. Let's go.

1446
01:23:41,030 --> 01:23:43,942
Wait. I thought we were
running after Billy?

1447
01:23:44,121 --> 01:23:46,724
No, we're gonna
wait here for now.

1448
01:23:50,190 --> 01:23:51,349
Billy?

1449
01:23:54,242 --> 01:23:55,306
Freddy?

1450
01:23:59,604 --> 01:24:01,437
Oh, how quaint.

1451
01:24:04,745 --> 01:24:06,776
Actually, I take that back.

1452
01:24:08,641 --> 01:24:10,268
What a shithole.

1453
01:24:53,749 --> 01:24:55,019
Just a second.

1454
01:24:59,658 --> 01:25:01,142
Hey, look, I'm late for
work already, all right?

1455
01:25:01,167 --> 01:25:03,325
We don't need any
magazines or whatever.

1456
01:25:03,373 --> 01:25:04,928
Oh, I'm not.

1457
01:25:06,075 --> 01:25:07,790
You probably don't
recognize me, but

1458
01:25:09,817 --> 01:25:11,372
I found my way home.

1459
01:25:12,820 --> 01:25:13,836
Mom.

1460
01:25:15,767 --> 01:25:16,902
It's me.

1461
01:25:18,277 --> 01:25:19,316
Oh, God.

1462
01:25:20,917 --> 01:25:21,941
Is it?

1463
01:25:24,552 --> 01:25:26,377
Um, hang on.

1464
01:25:28,147 --> 01:25:29,424
Who's at the door?

1465
01:25:30,671 --> 01:25:31,846
It's um...

1466
01:25:32,512 --> 01:25:34,282
It's no one, Travis.

1467
01:25:39,167 --> 01:25:40,667
That wasn't Dad, was it?

1468
01:25:41,734 --> 01:25:42,948
No, I...

1469
01:25:43,762 --> 01:25:46,492
Listen, it's um...

1470
01:25:48,473 --> 01:25:49,647
It's really you, huh?

1471
01:25:52,111 --> 01:25:53,674
I didn't mean to run away.

1472
01:25:54,547 --> 01:25:55,841
You know that, right?

1473
01:25:56,545 --> 01:25:59,219
I let go but it was by
accident, I...

1474
01:25:59,331 --> 01:26:01,021
Yeah, I know, I know.

1475
01:26:01,626 --> 01:26:03,428
I saw you.

1476
01:26:04,441 --> 01:26:05,449
What?

1477
01:26:08,826 --> 01:26:10,501
I saw you after.

1478
01:26:13,086 --> 01:26:15,776
So, it was never your fault.

1479
01:26:17,320 --> 01:26:19,225
I was 17.

1480
01:26:19,783 --> 01:26:21,489
And my dad, he kicked me out.

1481
01:26:21,864 --> 01:26:23,840
And your dad just...

1482
01:26:23,976 --> 01:26:26,348
decided not to be
a part of anything.

1483
01:26:26,893 --> 01:26:29,853
And I was hurting
and I was screwed up.

1484
01:26:32,113 --> 01:26:33,129
I wanted the tiger.

1485
01:26:33,154 --> 01:26:35,423
I know, I know, honey, but

1486
01:26:35,729 --> 01:26:37,856
Mom's not exactly going pro
here, okay?

1487
01:26:40,917 --> 01:26:42,037
Billy?

1488
01:26:42,783 --> 01:26:43,902
Billy!

1489
01:26:44,857 --> 01:26:46,032
Billy!

1490
01:26:46,532 --> 01:26:48,810
Jesus Christ, Billy,
this isn't funny!

1491
01:26:49,534 --> 01:26:50,534
Here you go, buddy.

1492
01:26:56,510 --> 01:26:59,407
But it's just once
I saw you with the police,

1493
01:26:59,812 --> 01:27:01,427
I realized that

1494
01:27:01,538 --> 01:27:04,966
they could do a better job taking
care of you than I ever will.

1495
01:27:10,135 --> 01:27:11,627
But you're good, right?

1496
01:27:13,303 --> 01:27:15,210
I mean you landed on your feet.

1497
01:27:16,385 --> 01:27:17,861
'Cause, I mean, you look real good.

1498
01:27:20,566 --> 01:27:22,018
It's just...

1499
01:27:23,870 --> 01:27:26,917
Now is not a really
good time for me, Billy.

1500
01:27:31,410 --> 01:27:33,537
All I wanted to do was

1501
01:27:34,899 --> 01:27:36,764
let you know
I'm doing good, but...

1502
01:27:38,194 --> 01:27:40,924
I have to get back
to my real family, so.

1503
01:27:43,068 --> 01:27:44,258
Here.

1504
01:27:47,906 --> 01:27:49,216
What's this?

1505
01:27:49,686 --> 01:27:52,425
Marilyn! What's
going on out there?

1506
01:27:53,091 --> 01:27:54,694
You might need it
more than me.

1507
01:28:12,515 --> 01:28:15,094
Freddy, you were right.
Sorry I yelled at you.

1508
01:28:15,547 --> 01:28:17,030
<i>Come home, Billy.</i>

1509
01:28:17,678 --> 01:28:19,123
<i>Come home.</i>

1510
01:28:19,290 --> 01:28:22,440
<i>Billy! Supervillain!
Supervillain!</i>

1511
01:28:38,993 --> 01:28:40,001
Shazam!

1512
01:28:53,936 --> 01:28:56,261
Who are you?
What do you want?

1513
01:28:56,453 --> 01:28:57,850
What do I want?

1514
01:28:58,749 --> 01:28:59,995
I want...

1515
01:29:05,015 --> 01:29:06,285
That.

1516
01:29:07,177 --> 01:29:08,471
Whoa.

1517
01:29:12,078 --> 01:29:13,388
Kick his ass, Billy!

1518
01:29:16,223 --> 01:29:17,231
Oh, God.

1519
01:29:17,256 --> 01:29:18,367
Yes, Billy.

1520
01:29:18,630 --> 01:29:20,107
Try it, by all means.

1521
01:29:20,703 --> 01:29:22,346
Let them go and I'll come inside.

1522
01:29:22,685 --> 01:29:24,804
Oh, first you come inside,

1523
01:29:24,868 --> 01:29:26,796
then maybe I'll let them go.

1524
01:29:43,595 --> 01:29:45,071
Good boy.

1525
01:29:47,540 --> 01:29:49,540
'Cause that's all you are, isn't it?

1526
01:29:50,349 --> 01:29:51,666
How old are you?

1527
01:29:51,944 --> 01:29:54,373
- Basically, 15.
- Hmm.

1528
01:29:56,133 --> 01:29:57,752
When I was a child,

1529
01:29:57,848 --> 01:29:59,951
the old man told me
I wasn't good enough.

1530
01:30:00,030 --> 01:30:01,443
And here you are,

1531
01:30:01,840 --> 01:30:03,316
a coward.

1532
01:30:04,077 --> 01:30:05,478
Run from me?

1533
01:30:05,925 --> 01:30:08,147
And that wizard chooses you.
You're not a hero.

1534
01:30:08,657 --> 01:30:11,491
But I'm gonna give you
the opportunity to be one.

1535
01:30:12,127 --> 01:30:13,936
Give me the power
of a champion.

1536
01:30:14,074 --> 01:30:15,637
No, don't do it, Billy!

1537
01:30:32,307 --> 01:30:33,633
Give me the power

1538
01:30:34,127 --> 01:30:35,174
and I'll let them go.

1539
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:36,428
Darla, no.

1540
01:30:36,510 --> 01:30:38,200
Don't, don't go, Billy!

1541
01:30:38,361 --> 01:30:40,472
Don't go! Don't go, Billy!

1542
01:30:40,567 --> 01:30:42,622
No, no, I-I have to,
I have to, it's...

1543
01:30:42,953 --> 01:30:45,969
It's what a good brother
would do, right?

1544
01:30:50,604 --> 01:30:51,794
Billy.

1545
01:31:18,140 --> 01:31:20,799
I dedicated my life
to getting here.

1546
01:31:22,075 --> 01:31:23,480
I scoured the earth.

1547
01:31:24,027 --> 01:31:25,385
No one believed me.

1548
01:31:26,438 --> 01:31:27,541
No one helped.

1549
01:31:28,526 --> 01:31:29,526
Not the wizard.

1550
01:31:30,955 --> 01:31:32,193
Not my family.

1551
01:31:34,150 --> 01:31:35,730
I only had myself.

1552
01:31:36,487 --> 01:31:37,606
I get it.

1553
01:31:39,043 --> 01:31:40,392
I get what that's like.

1554
01:31:42,478 --> 01:31:44,161
Feeling like you're
all alone in the world.

1555
01:31:44,320 --> 01:31:45,399
Stand.

1556
01:31:46,035 --> 01:31:48,797
Feeling like there's that one
thing, if you could just find it.

1557
01:31:48,928 --> 01:31:50,672
Then you'd finally
be good enough.

1558
01:31:50,769 --> 01:31:51,912
Stand.

1559
01:31:54,132 --> 01:31:55,902
The champion's name.

1560
01:31:57,386 --> 01:31:58,521
Say it.

1561
01:32:25,848 --> 01:32:27,006
Look, no offense, mister,

1562
01:32:27,031 --> 01:32:30,070
but I don't think these things
have your best interest at heart.

1563
01:32:30,377 --> 01:32:33,496
Don't listen to this child.

1564
01:32:33,746 --> 01:32:35,817
Take the staff.

1565
01:32:36,200 --> 01:32:41,304
Hold it and say
the champion's name.

1566
01:32:41,396 --> 01:32:42,857
They're using you.

1567
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:46,023
You have to see that.
That they are using you.

1568
01:32:46,076 --> 01:32:47,410
Say your name.

1569
01:32:50,860 --> 01:32:52,185
His name...

1570
01:32:52,820 --> 01:32:54,924
is Captain Sparklefingers.

1571
01:32:54,983 --> 01:32:56,593
And we're gonna
keep throwing things

1572
01:32:56,627 --> 01:32:58,746
at your big, fat, ugly ass head

1573
01:32:58,841 --> 01:33:00,769
until you let our brother go.

1574
01:33:25,860 --> 01:33:27,892
Boy, am I glad I didn't
sell that batarang.

1575
01:33:28,077 --> 01:33:29,331
Pedro, is that a lamp?

1576
01:33:29,412 --> 01:33:31,595
- It's an ugly one.
- Come on, come on, come on.

1577
01:33:31,719 --> 01:33:33,846
Guys, I appreciate the
thought, I really do.

1578
01:33:33,885 --> 01:33:35,504
But I don't think your
weapons are gonna help.

1579
01:33:35,529 --> 01:33:37,052
You can put 'em down now.

1580
01:33:38,438 --> 01:33:39,875
The door was right here.

1581
01:33:39,950 --> 01:33:41,180
Billy, how do we
get out of here?

1582
01:33:41,450 --> 01:33:43,245
What, you think I know?
I don't know.

1583
01:33:44,009 --> 01:33:45,040
This way!

1584
01:33:45,160 --> 01:33:47,231
Go, go, go, go, go with Darla.
Good job, Darla!

1585
01:33:47,297 --> 01:33:48,512
Go, go, go, go!

1586
01:33:48,575 --> 01:33:49,599
Kids?

1587
01:33:50,877 --> 01:33:52,099
Why is this open?

1588
01:33:52,278 --> 01:33:53,564
Freddy?

1589
01:33:53,914 --> 01:33:54,929
Mary?

1590
01:33:59,899 --> 01:34:01,494
Freddy, Freddy, keep up.

1591
01:34:02,568 --> 01:34:03,790
Darla, stay in front.

1592
01:34:04,696 --> 01:34:05,799
We gotta hurry.

1593
01:34:29,574 --> 01:34:31,042
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

1594
01:34:31,885 --> 01:34:33,600
So many doors.

1595
01:34:34,356 --> 01:34:36,841
One of these has to be
a way out, right?

1596
01:34:37,010 --> 01:34:38,438
Yeah, I would hope so.

1597
01:34:55,481 --> 01:34:56,671
Not this one.

1598
01:35:10,238 --> 01:35:11,365
Okay, no more doors.

1599
01:35:11,390 --> 01:35:12,685
Nobody open any more doors.

1600
01:35:12,710 --> 01:35:14,637
Come on, Billy,
what are we gonna do?

1601
01:35:14,703 --> 01:35:15,767
Darla, I don't know.

1602
01:35:15,261 --> 01:35:16,587
Billy, yes, you do,
just-just think.

1603
01:35:16,612 --> 01:35:17,834
How'd you get out last time?

1604
01:35:17,859 --> 01:35:19,041
Well, uh, l-last time I
thought about the subway

1605
01:35:19,066 --> 01:35:20,066
and I was on the subway.

1606
01:35:20,536 --> 01:35:22,615
Then Billy, look,
think about the subway.

1607
01:35:22,640 --> 01:35:24,898
Think about any place
except for here, okay?

1608
01:35:47,313 --> 01:35:48,407
Come on, come on, come on.

1609
01:35:48,432 --> 01:35:49,884
Why are you covering my eyes?

1610
01:35:50,275 --> 01:35:52,983
Really? This is the first place
you think of? Wow!

1611
01:35:53,008 --> 01:35:54,119
You're welcome.

1612
01:35:54,144 --> 01:35:55,744
Why can't I see what's inside?

1613
01:35:55,816 --> 01:35:57,276
You are not old enough.

1614
01:35:57,373 --> 01:35:59,675
Old enough to know
that was great music.

1615
01:35:59,954 --> 01:36:01,040
Not my thing.

1616
01:36:01,064 --> 01:36:02,232
Where's Freddy?

1617
01:36:02,257 --> 01:36:03,583
Yeah, you too, Sriracha, hey,

1618
01:36:03,608 --> 01:36:05,219
have a holly, jolly Christmas.

1619
01:36:05,364 --> 01:36:06,682
Freddy, what are you doing?

1620
01:36:06,732 --> 01:36:08,327
Ah, it's nice people.

1621
01:36:08,383 --> 01:36:09,748
- Nice pe...? Come on.
- Is that glitter?

1622
01:36:09,773 --> 01:36:11,328
They have glitter.
Can I get glitter?

1623
01:36:11,353 --> 01:36:13,178
- No, not from them.
- Please?

1624
01:36:22,596 --> 01:36:24,080
Go, go, go, go!
Everybody go!

1625
01:36:24,498 --> 01:36:25,776
Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.

1626
01:36:25,872 --> 01:36:27,539
One, two, three,
hold onto me.

1627
01:36:35,941 --> 01:36:37,653
Carnival. Go, go, go.
Mary, go.

1628
01:36:37,692 --> 01:36:38,827
Go. Come on, Pedro.

1629
01:36:38,852 --> 01:36:39,869
Come on.

1630
01:36:51,841 --> 01:36:53,511
Walk, just be cool,
act naturally,

1631
01:36:53,536 --> 01:36:55,718
like kids naturally act
in a carnival.

1632
01:36:55,841 --> 01:36:57,214
- He's not gonna look for you...
- Is that him?

1633
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:58,595
Oh, my God, guys.

1634
01:36:58,892 --> 01:36:59,923
Hey, Powerboy.

1635
01:36:59,948 --> 01:37:00,969
He's an impersonator, okay?

1636
01:37:00,994 --> 01:37:02,931
I'm an impersonator.
I'm a fake version of myself.

1637
01:37:02,956 --> 01:37:04,162
Don't take pictures...

1638
01:37:06,037 --> 01:37:07,228
Shazam!

1639
01:37:14,502 --> 01:37:15,692
Hey, where'd he go?

1640
01:37:24,378 --> 01:37:27,092
Oh, man, oh, man,
I just spit on a baby!

1641
01:37:28,788 --> 01:37:30,256
Yo, what is that?

1642
01:37:36,032 --> 01:37:37,508
Champion!

1643
01:37:40,450 --> 01:37:42,268
You don't deserve that name.

1644
01:37:46,672 --> 01:37:50,196
Hiding behind innocent people
who will now die.

1645
01:37:51,980 --> 01:37:56,305
Because deep down, you're
still just a scared, little boy.

1646
01:37:58,057 --> 01:37:59,724
Oh, no.

1647
01:38:00,692 --> 01:38:02,108
Run!

1648
01:38:02,505 --> 01:38:03,703
Run!

1649
01:38:17,098 --> 01:38:18,963
- What do we do? What do we do?
- Hold on!

1650
01:38:19,015 --> 01:38:20,737
- To what?
- The bar, you idiot!

1651
01:38:29,691 --> 01:38:31,461
Well, you wanted me to be a hero.

1652
01:38:31,740 --> 01:38:32,822
Are you kidding?

1653
01:38:32,972 --> 01:38:34,123
Okay, no. Old guy's up there

1654
01:38:34,148 --> 01:38:35,895
harboring multiple
spiritual entities,

1655
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:37,485
plus, I mean, he has
the same powers as you,

1656
01:38:37,525 --> 01:38:39,844
plus, you know, a-and
he knows what he's doing,

1657
01:38:39,899 --> 01:38:42,145
plus, you're my best friend,
I don't want you to die.

1658
01:38:43,619 --> 01:38:45,858
If a superhero
can't save his family,

1659
01:38:47,282 --> 01:38:48,663
he's not much of a hero.

1660
01:38:53,058 --> 01:38:54,597
That was a decent catchphrase.

1661
01:38:55,504 --> 01:38:56,639
Shazam!

1662
01:39:05,626 --> 01:39:07,412
Now let's try this again.

1663
01:39:21,662 --> 01:39:23,345
Or try that again.

1664
01:39:31,239 --> 01:39:32,739
Billy, look out!

1665
01:39:35,248 --> 01:39:36,360
Laser eyes?

1666
01:39:36,455 --> 01:39:37,788
Guys, he's got laser eyes!

1667
01:39:37,846 --> 01:39:39,981
Too bad your aim sucks balls!

1668
01:39:49,817 --> 01:39:50,976
His power matrix.

1669
01:39:51,127 --> 01:39:52,309
His what what?

1670
01:39:52,431 --> 01:39:54,875
When the demon guys leave
his eye, he loses his powers.

1671
01:39:55,839 --> 01:39:57,450
That's why the
batarang hurt him.

1672
01:39:58,771 --> 01:40:01,247
Hey, over here!

1673
01:40:01,870 --> 01:40:02,871
W-What are you doing?

1674
01:40:02,896 --> 01:40:03,942
Trust me. Divide and conquer.

1675
01:40:03,967 --> 01:40:06,315
We separate the sins from the
eye, and he's just an old man.

1676
01:40:06,716 --> 01:40:08,153
Gather the mutts.

1677
01:40:46,180 --> 01:40:48,982
Here, take it.
Take it, it's for you.

1678
01:40:49,860 --> 01:40:51,019
Hold it tight.

1679
01:40:51,574 --> 01:40:52,828
Close your eyes.

1680
01:40:53,619 --> 01:40:55,793
Everything's gonna be okay.
Okay?

1681
01:40:56,972 --> 01:40:58,044
Okay.

1682
01:41:21,588 --> 01:41:22,628
Get up.

1683
01:41:38,507 --> 01:41:39,539
Shazam!

1684
01:42:08,325 --> 01:42:09,921
Playtime's over, boy.

1685
01:42:11,146 --> 01:42:12,868
Your friends can't
help you anymore.

1686
01:42:18,621 --> 01:42:19,652
Hey!

1687
01:42:46,361 --> 01:42:47,567
Shazam!

1688
01:43:12,341 --> 01:43:13,420
Nice trick.

1689
01:43:13,904 --> 01:43:15,047
Catchy.

1690
01:43:15,555 --> 01:43:17,166
One simple word.

1691
01:43:17,977 --> 01:43:19,366
I have a better trick.

1692
01:43:20,360 --> 01:43:21,503
Four words.

1693
01:43:22,915 --> 01:43:24,335
Kill the little girl.

1694
01:43:25,474 --> 01:43:26,911
- No, please!
- No!

1695
01:43:30,527 --> 01:43:31,892
Stop!

1696
01:43:47,293 --> 01:43:50,436
Billy, there's one more
demon guy in his eye!

1697
01:43:50,494 --> 01:43:52,160
You gotta just
rip it out of his face...

1698
01:43:52,481 --> 01:43:53,973
It's where he gets his power.

1699
01:43:58,177 --> 01:43:59,375
Reach for it.

1700
01:44:01,161 --> 01:44:02,454
I dare you.

1701
01:44:11,190 --> 01:44:12,437
Wise decision.

1702
01:44:14,857 --> 01:44:16,333
Hands on the staff.

1703
01:44:17,697 --> 01:44:19,189
Billy, don't do this. Billy!

1704
01:44:19,326 --> 01:44:21,239
- Billy!
- Don't do it, Billy!

1705
01:44:41,059 --> 01:44:42,329
Say my name

1706
01:44:42,354 --> 01:44:44,893
so my power may
flow through you.

1707
01:44:45,080 --> 01:44:47,977
I open my heart to you,
Billy Batson.

1708
01:44:48,129 --> 01:44:49,716
And in so doing,

1709
01:44:49,741 --> 01:44:52,383
choose you as champion.

1710
01:44:52,723 --> 01:44:56,453
With your heart,
unlock your greatest power.

1711
01:44:56,560 --> 01:44:59,259
The thrones of our
brothers and sisters await!

1712
01:45:07,428 --> 01:45:08,896
All hands on deck.

1713
01:45:14,683 --> 01:45:15,755
Say my name.

1714
01:45:17,175 --> 01:45:18,350
Billy!

1715
01:45:18,599 --> 01:45:19,678
No, not my name. No.

1716
01:45:19,703 --> 01:45:21,940
Say the name that I say
to turn into this guy.

1717
01:45:22,803 --> 01:45:24,104
Shazam!

1718
01:46:02,497 --> 01:46:03,815
Guys.

1719
01:46:05,232 --> 01:46:06,613
What's happening?

1720
01:46:11,028 --> 01:46:12,504
I can fly!

1721
01:46:17,180 --> 01:46:18,339
Guys.

1722
01:46:18,593 --> 01:46:20,133
Check out these guns.

1723
01:46:21,518 --> 01:46:22,748
No.

1724
01:46:23,725 --> 01:46:25,305
It's not possible!

1725
01:46:27,241 --> 01:46:29,678
Gee whiz, mister.
Sorry I took your game.

1726
01:46:29,751 --> 01:46:31,529
You want it back?

1727
01:46:33,408 --> 01:46:35,503
Guys, I don't believe in violence,

1728
01:46:35,592 --> 01:46:38,933
but I think we should kick this
guy's butt, like, really hard.

1729
01:46:50,406 --> 01:46:51,938
Guys, I think
I can move really

1730
01:46:53,073 --> 01:46:54,128
fast.

1731
01:46:54,577 --> 01:46:55,814
Hyperspeed!

1732
01:46:55,846 --> 01:46:56,966
Check!

1733
01:47:05,691 --> 01:47:06,882
Billy!

1734
01:47:07,072 --> 01:47:08,239
The eye.

1735
01:47:15,580 --> 01:47:16,715
Look out!

1736
01:47:18,871 --> 01:47:19,990
Whoa!

1737
01:47:21,541 --> 01:47:22,541
What?

1738
01:47:26,498 --> 01:47:27,903
You almost exploded me!

1739
01:48:14,159 --> 01:48:16,114
Dude, I've studied
the fighting techniques

1740
01:48:16,139 --> 01:48:17,675
of every single superhero.

1741
01:48:19,066 --> 01:48:20,344
What do you got?

1742
01:48:24,050 --> 01:48:25,486
Well, that's terrifying.

1743
01:48:59,623 --> 01:49:01,829
Enough games, boy.

1744
01:49:02,659 --> 01:49:04,421
You think a pack of children can...

1745
01:49:07,488 --> 01:49:08,528
Wait, what?!

1746
01:49:08,647 --> 01:49:11,079
You will beg for mercy

1747
01:49:11,167 --> 01:49:13,104
as I feast on your heart.

1748
01:49:14,060 --> 01:49:15,132
Slow...

1749
01:49:16,586 --> 01:49:18,681
Are you making
some big, evil guy

1750
01:49:18,706 --> 01:49:20,268
speech right now or something?

1751
01:49:20,293 --> 01:49:22,590
You're like, a mile
away from me right now.

1752
01:49:22,615 --> 01:49:23,927
There's cars and trucks...

1753
01:49:23,952 --> 01:49:26,721
I will have the world eating
out of the palm of my hand...

1754
01:49:26,809 --> 01:49:29,412
All I see is mouth moving.
I don't hear any...

1755
01:49:29,445 --> 01:49:31,192
Only I

1756
01:49:31,263 --> 01:49:33,315
have the power to unleash...

1757
01:49:34,669 --> 01:49:35,844
Oh, whatever, screw it.

1758
01:50:06,995 --> 01:50:08,320
Oh, my gosh, those people!

1759
01:50:16,360 --> 01:50:17,448
Hi!

1760
01:50:18,186 --> 01:50:19,409
I caught you!

1761
01:50:30,520 --> 01:50:31,536
I got it!

1762
01:50:32,211 --> 01:50:33,227
I got it!

1763
01:50:38,749 --> 01:50:40,273
Oh, my God, I do got it.

1764
01:50:56,779 --> 01:50:58,175
You're not gonna believe this,

1765
01:50:58,200 --> 01:50:59,993
but you're actually the
first villain I've ever fought.

1766
01:51:00,573 --> 01:51:02,645
It's, like, kind of
a huge deal for me.

1767
01:51:17,684 --> 01:51:19,112
Somebody help!

1768
01:51:28,064 --> 01:51:29,310
Hadouken!

1769
01:51:33,743 --> 01:51:34,743
Hi!

1770
01:51:34,768 --> 01:51:36,196
Wow, it's really you.

1771
01:51:37,875 --> 01:51:40,650
My name is Darla
and I've been really good!

1772
01:51:41,002 --> 01:51:42,030
What?

1773
01:51:45,737 --> 01:51:47,190
Oh, crap.

1774
01:51:48,707 --> 01:51:50,350
No, no, no, no.
No, no!

1775
01:52:18,381 --> 01:52:19,421
Oh, my God!

1776
01:52:19,446 --> 01:52:21,016
I'm giving you suitcase wedgies!

1777
01:52:58,178 --> 01:53:00,416
So this is about your
Seven Deadly Sins, right?

1778
01:53:01,284 --> 01:53:03,570
I mean, I've never been
great at math, but uh...

1779
01:53:03,906 --> 01:53:06,293
The big, angry one,
that's Wrath, yeah?

1780
01:53:06,678 --> 01:53:08,956
And then Gluttony, obvi.

1781
01:53:09,729 --> 01:53:10,809
Pride.

1782
01:53:11,263 --> 01:53:13,754
Greed and Sloth, Lust, who

1783
01:53:13,805 --> 01:53:16,980
I thought was gonna be
way hotter, if I'm being honest.

1784
01:53:17,366 --> 01:53:20,279
But that's only six. Where's...
Where's lucky number seven?

1785
01:53:20,652 --> 01:53:22,572
Where's little man?
Where's Envy?

1786
01:53:22,775 --> 01:53:25,623
Is he just scared of me and my
family 'cause we're so awesome?

1787
01:53:25,648 --> 01:53:26,980
'Cause I get that.

1788
01:53:27,167 --> 01:53:29,318
Like, the other sins, they
get to come out and fight

1789
01:53:29,524 --> 01:53:31,175
'cause they're big
and strong and scary.

1790
01:53:31,474 --> 01:53:32,735
But Envy,

1791
01:53:33,799 --> 01:53:35,235
he's just a runt.

1792
01:53:47,825 --> 01:53:49,151
And that's why
all the other sins

1793
01:53:49,176 --> 01:53:51,151
never invite him
out to play, man.

1794
01:53:51,245 --> 01:53:52,801
'Cause they all know who'd win.

1795
01:53:53,806 --> 01:53:55,016
And it's not weak,

1796
01:53:55,060 --> 01:53:57,588
worthless, ugly

1797
01:53:57,691 --> 01:53:59,005
Envy.

1798
01:54:03,900 --> 01:54:05,893
No!

1799
01:54:25,097 --> 01:54:26,248
Gotcha.

1800
01:54:27,049 --> 01:54:28,247
Shazam!

1801
01:54:35,509 --> 01:54:36,557
Shazam!

1802
01:54:47,238 --> 01:54:48,984
Ready to go
round up your buddies?

1803
01:55:18,216 --> 01:55:19,446
No.

1804
01:55:20,266 --> 01:55:21,313
No!

1805
01:55:51,256 --> 01:55:53,105
Here's the thing about power.

1806
01:55:53,305 --> 01:55:54,884
What good's power

1807
01:55:54,955 --> 01:55:56,892
if you got nobody
to share it with?

1808
01:55:58,584 --> 01:56:00,306
- Nice.
- Ta-da.

1809
01:56:00,331 --> 01:56:01,480
That's disgusting.

1810
01:56:01,505 --> 01:56:02,719
Fatality.

1811
01:56:04,182 --> 01:56:05,316
I got the voice.

1812
01:56:09,099 --> 01:56:10,377
What's that?

1813
01:56:15,901 --> 01:56:17,822
I can have anything
I've ever wanted?

1814
01:56:21,629 --> 01:56:22,826
Billy, no.

1815
01:56:22,883 --> 01:56:24,303
No, no, no, no!

1816
01:56:30,392 --> 01:56:31,972
- You should hear yourself.
- That's not funny.

1817
01:56:32,029 --> 01:56:34,182
What, you think I'm gonna
put a demon ball in my head?

1818
01:56:34,235 --> 01:56:35,433
That's disgusting.

1819
01:56:35,500 --> 01:56:37,302
- It's not funny.
- Pretty funny. You got me going.

1820
01:56:37,327 --> 01:56:39,311
Uh, guys, guys.

1821
01:56:42,421 --> 01:56:43,540
What?

1822
01:56:45,090 --> 01:56:46,670
Oh, hey.

1823
01:56:46,900 --> 01:56:48,035
Oh, wow.

1824
01:56:50,570 --> 01:56:51,910
- Oh.
- Oh.

1825
01:56:57,045 --> 01:56:58,481
All right, we did it!

1826
01:56:58,824 --> 01:57:00,530
- Whoo!
- All right! Yeah!

1827
01:57:01,306 --> 01:57:02,393
Thank you!

1828
01:57:03,667 --> 01:57:05,032
We did it!

1829
01:57:06,353 --> 01:57:09,075
Yeah, you guys are all safe.
There's no more danger.

1830
01:57:23,108 --> 01:57:24,783
You sure this is gonna work?

1831
01:57:26,438 --> 01:57:27,684
Told ya.

1832
01:57:46,767 --> 01:57:48,728
You guys know
what this place is, right?

1833
01:57:48,819 --> 01:57:51,224
A dark, haunted cave
with demon statues.

1834
01:57:51,503 --> 01:57:54,384
Well, yes, but also...

1835
01:57:57,240 --> 01:57:58,351
Lair!

1836
01:57:58,541 --> 01:58:00,001
We got a lair!

1837
01:58:00,173 --> 01:58:01,364
Lair.

1838
01:58:02,030 --> 01:58:03,856
- Lair.
- We got a lair.

1839
01:58:06,163 --> 01:58:07,568
What's a lair?

1840
01:58:08,145 --> 01:58:10,050
And thanks to six superheroes,

1841
01:58:10,121 --> 01:58:11,954
citizens are back in their homes

1842
01:58:12,036 --> 01:58:13,870
safe again with their families.

1843
01:58:14,172 --> 01:58:16,672
And here with an eyewitness
account of the events...

1844
01:58:16,714 --> 01:58:18,976
It was f***ing crazy, man!

1845
01:58:19,137 --> 01:58:21,256
Creatures from f***ing hell!

1846
01:58:21,314 --> 01:58:23,949
Lightning coming out of
everyone's f***ing everything.

1847
01:58:24,080 --> 01:58:26,477
And that is not f***ing cool, man!

1848
01:58:27,314 --> 01:58:28,600
I'm tired of it.

1849
01:58:31,212 --> 01:58:32,390
<i>♪ This will be ♪</i>

1850
01:58:33,221 --> 01:58:34,571
<i>♪ An everlasting love ♪</i>

1851
01:58:36,113 --> 01:58:37,248
Guys,

1852
01:58:37,613 --> 01:58:38,986
all hands on deck.

1853
01:58:39,012 --> 01:58:40,012
Oh!

1854
01:58:42,112 --> 01:58:43,469
W-W-W-Wait!

1855
01:58:43,532 --> 01:58:44,564
Wait.

1856
01:58:44,988 --> 01:58:46,511
Thank you for this food.

1857
01:58:46,765 --> 01:58:48,273
Thank you for this day.

1858
01:58:48,749 --> 01:58:50,178
Thank you for this family.

1859
01:58:50,964 --> 01:58:53,419
I thought maybe
this time I'd stay.

1860
01:58:54,432 --> 01:58:57,044
I mean, after all,

1861
01:58:57,099 --> 01:58:58,494
I'm home.

1862
01:59:35,547 --> 01:59:36,548
Nope.

1863
01:59:38,949 --> 01:59:40,021
Okay.

1864
01:59:43,368 --> 01:59:44,617
What are you doin'?

1865
01:59:45,066 --> 01:59:47,371
Waiting for your
imaginary BFF to show up?

1866
01:59:56,985 --> 01:59:58,176
What are you guys doing here?

1867
01:59:58,382 --> 01:59:59,890
Well, we're having lunch with you.

1868
02:00:00,073 --> 02:00:01,755
But you guys have
different lunch periods.

1869
02:00:01,845 --> 02:00:04,114
Well, we made a very
special arrangement.

1870
02:00:05,198 --> 02:00:06,753
Darla, what's going on?

1871
02:00:06,824 --> 02:00:08,285
Why are you asking me?

1872
02:00:08,645 --> 02:00:10,082
Freddy Freeman!

1873
02:00:12,066 --> 02:00:13,827
This guy...

1874
02:00:13,859 --> 02:00:16,988
taught me everything I know
about being a dope superhero.

1875
02:00:17,013 --> 02:00:19,317
True story, you should
get some pointers

1876
02:00:19,342 --> 02:00:21,461
from him. What's goin' on,

1877
02:00:21,490 --> 02:00:24,291
my best bud...
in the whole world?

1878
02:00:24,346 --> 02:00:27,568
And also new kids that I'm
meeting for the first time

1879
02:00:27,593 --> 02:00:29,150
but seem very cool?

1880
02:00:29,175 --> 02:00:30,209
Uh... huh,

1881
02:00:30,234 --> 02:00:33,006
I invited another friend,
I hope that's okay.

1882
02:00:39,836 --> 02:00:40,915
Huh!
