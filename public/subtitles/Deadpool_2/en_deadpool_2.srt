Domino my email?

2381
02:06:06,184 --> 02:06:08,050
Wade, is that you?

2382
02:06:10,313 --> 02:06:11,644
I guess Stryker finally

2383
02:06:11,731 --> 02:06:13,096
figured out
how to shut you up.

2384
02:06:15,985 --> 02:06:17,350
(GUNSHOT)

2385
02:06:19,697 --> 02:06:22,940
Hey! It's me!
Don't scratch!

2386
02:06:23,117 --> 02:06:25,108
Just cleaning up
the timelines!

2387
02:06:25,203 --> 02:06:28,992
Look, eventually you're
going to hang up the claws...

2388
02:06:29,082 --> 02:06:31,323
and it's gonna make
a lot of people very sad.

2389
02:06:31,709 --> 02:06:32,699
Huh?

2390
02:06:32,794 --> 02:06:34,410
But one day, your old pal
Wade's gonna ask you...

2391
02:06:34,504 --> 02:06:36,461
to get back
in the saddle again.

2392
02:06:37,340 --> 02:06:39,877
And when he does,
say yes.

2393
02:06:41,135 --> 02:06:43,092
Oh, right.
(GUNSHOTS)

2394
02:06:44,013 --> 02:06:45,299
(WHISPERS) Love you!

2395
02:06:47,683 --> 02:06:49,299
Goddamn, that's beautiful.

2396
02:06:50,895 --> 02:06:51,885
(GUNSHOT)

2397
02:06:56,692 --> 02:06:58,524
You're welcome, Canada.

2398
02:07:11,040 --> 02:07:12,201
Boy howdy.

2399
02:07:14,085 --> 02:07:16,952
Hi. This is a toughie.
(BABY CRYING)

2400
02:07:17,046 --> 02:07:18,036
Yeesh.

2401
02:07:18,339 --> 02:07:20,751
Oh, yes. You're already
practicing your salute, huh?

2402
02:07:21,968 --> 02:07:24,756
Yes, you are. Well, we'll
take care of that, won't we?

2403
02:07:24,846 --> 02:07:27,634
Jesus Christ! This is
so much harder than I thought.

2404
02:07:28,474 --> 02:07:30,056
Oh, I'm going to hell.

2405
02:07:30,143 --> 02:07:31,725
That makes two of us.

2406
02:07:31,894 --> 02:07:32,975
You can do this.
(CLICKS TONGUE)

2407
02:07:33,146 --> 02:07:36,138
This is crazy. This is crazy.
This is crazy. This is crazy.

2408
02:07:36,232 --> 02:07:37,393
All right.

2409
02:07:38,442 --> 02:07:39,557
(SIGHS)

2410
02:07:44,740 --> 02:07:46,651
Maximum effort.

2411
02:07:47,160 --> 02:07:50,118
(<i>IF I COULD TURN BACK TIME</i>
CONTINUES PLAYING)

2412
02:09:08,366 --> 02:09:10,357
(HIP-HOP MUSIC PLAYING)

2413
02:12:54,550 --> 02:12:56,291
(CHOIR SINGING)

2414
02:13:24,830 --> 02:13:27,071
That's okay.
Let me see here.

2415
02:13:27,166 --> 02:13:28,622
Oh, God.

2416
02:13:28,709 --> 02:13:30,620
That's why you're
such a little bastard.

2417
02:13:30,711 --> 02:13:32,622
No one's ever changed you.

2418
02:13:33,130 --> 02:13:35,838
Yeah, you got a big, old
stinky in there, don't you?

2419
02:13:35,925 --> 02:13:38,383
God, it smells like
Hitler's anus...

2420
02:13:38,761 --> 02:13:41,298
which would makes sense,
wouldn't it? Yeah.

2421
02:13:41,388 --> 02:13:42,503
I think we both know

2422
02:13:42,598 --> 02:13:43,713
I don't have
what it takes to do this...

2423
02:13:43,807 --> 02:13:46,174
so I'm just gonna change
your diaper real quick...

2424
02:13:46,268 --> 02:13:48,134
and then I'm gonna come back
with my friend, Cable.

2425
02:13:48,229 --> 02:13:49,560
He loves killing kids.
