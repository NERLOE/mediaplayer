1
00:00:13,533 --> 00:00:15,533
Okay, hold on, don't shoot.

2
00:00:15,957 --> 00:00:18,757
- Do you see where they're going? 
- Mm-hmm

3
00:00:18,781 --> 00:00:20,781
Okay...

4
00:00:29,381 --> 00:00:31,254
- Can you see?
- Yeah.

5
00:00:31,298 --> 00:00:32,353
- Are you sure?
- Mm-hmm.

6
00:00:32,377 --> 00:00:34,535
How about now?
Can you see now?

7
00:00:37,169 --> 00:00:38,170
All right.

8
00:00:39,155 --> 00:00:40,961
Ready? Three fingers.

9
00:00:41,545 --> 00:00:43,446
Nice!

10
00:00:43,968 --> 00:00:46,759
- Nice throw, kiddo!
- Go.

11
00:00:47,227 --> 00:00:50,699
Hey, you guys want mayo
or mustard, or both?

12
00:00:51,143 --> 00:00:53,223
Who wants mayo on a hotdog?

13
00:00:53,356 --> 00:00:56,647
Pardon your brothers. Two mustards, please!
Thanks, momma.

14
00:00:56,695 --> 00:00:57,867
Got it.

15
00:00:57,953 --> 00:01:00,228
Nate, mayo or mustard?

16
00:01:00,494 --> 00:01:02,260
I want ketchup.

17
00:01:04,613 --> 00:01:06,182
Mind your elbow...

18
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,315
Good job, Hawkeye!
Go get your arrow.

19
00:01:14,339 --> 00:01:17,294
Hey, guys. Enough practice.
Soup's on.

20
00:01:17,967 --> 00:01:20,789
All right. We're coming.
We're hungry.

21
00:01:21,656 --> 00:01:23,352
Lila, let's go.

22
00:01:26,178 --> 00:01:27,452
Lila?

23
00:01:30,234 --> 00:01:31,235
Honey?

24
00:01:35,164 --> 00:01:36,430
Babe?

25
00:01:45,978 --> 00:01:46,979
Babe?

26
00:01:48,965 --> 00:01:49,966
Babe?

27
00:01:52,218 --> 00:01:53,218
Boys!

28
00:01:55,477 --> 00:01:56,477
Boys?

29
00:01:58,590 --> 00:01:59,692
Laura!

30
00:02:43,814 --> 00:02:45,377
You don't need to do that,

31
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,856
because you're just
holding the position.

32
00:02:49,279 --> 00:02:50,279
Come on.

33
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:51,825
That was close.

34
00:02:53,349 --> 00:02:55,210
That's a goal. We're
now one a-piece.

35
00:02:55,279 --> 00:02:56,936
I would like to try again.

36
00:02:59,288 --> 00:03:00,289
We're tied up.

37
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,486
Feel the tension? It's fun.

38
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:06,270
That was terrible. Now you
have a chance to win.

39
00:03:06,684 --> 00:03:09,522
And you won. Congratulations.

40
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,273
Fair game.

41
00:03:12,095 --> 00:03:13,486
Good sport.

42
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:16,098
You had fun?

43
00:03:18,086 --> 00:03:19,276
It was fun.

44
00:03:42,618 --> 00:03:43,783
This thing on?

45
00:03:46,286 --> 00:03:48,427
Hey, Miss Potts... Pep.

46
00:03:50,327 --> 00:03:52,219
If you find this recording...

47
00:03:52,571 --> 00:03:56,831
don't post it, on social media.
It's gonna be a real tear-jerker.

48
00:03:57,910 --> 00:03:59,888
I don't know if you're
ever gonna see these.

49
00:03:59,896 --> 00:04:02,297
I don't even know
if you're still...

50
00:04:02,953 --> 00:04:04,461
Oh, God. I hope so...

51
00:04:05,466 --> 00:04:09,784
Today is day 21... uh, 22.

52
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:13,581
You know, if it wasn't for
the existensial terror of

53
00:04:13,606 --> 00:04:15,746
staring into the
literal void of space,

54
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:17,935
I'd say, I'm feeling
more better today.

55
00:04:18,126 --> 00:04:22,183
The infection's run its course,
thanks to the blue meanie back there.

56
00:04:22,324 --> 00:04:25,099
You'd love her. Very practical.

57
00:04:25,490 --> 00:04:27,521
Only a tiny bit sadistic.

58
00:04:32,536 --> 00:04:36,453
Some fuel cells were cracked during battle, but
we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge

59
00:04:36,478 --> 00:04:39,336
to buy ourselves, about,
48 hours of playtime.

60
00:04:43,177 --> 00:04:44,904
But it's now dead in the water.

61
00:04:44,929 --> 00:04:47,931
We're 1,000 lightyears
from the nearest 7-11.

62
00:04:49,957 --> 00:04:52,450
Oxygen will run out
tomorrow morning.

63
00:04:53,476 --> 00:04:55,203
That'll be it.

64
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:00,231
And Pep, I...

65
00:05:00,256 --> 00:05:02,671
I know I said no
more surprises, but

66
00:05:02,696 --> 00:05:05,932
I gotta say I was really hoping
to pull off one last one.

67
00:05:05,957 --> 00:05:07,291
But it looks like...

68
00:05:07,316 --> 00:05:09,325
Well, you know what
it looks like.

69
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:13,170
Don't feel bad about this.

70
00:05:13,195 --> 00:05:16,282
I mean actually if you
grovel for a couple weeks,

71
00:05:17,057 --> 00:05:19,592
and then, move on
with enormous guilt.

72
00:05:25,121 --> 00:05:28,450
I should probably lie down.
I'm gonna caress my

73
00:05:32,227 --> 00:05:34,080
Please know that...

74
00:05:34,105 --> 00:05:37,427
When I drift off, it will be

75
00:05:37,452 --> 00:05:41,837
goodbye the whole time...

76
00:05:42,112 --> 00:05:43,792
I'll think about you.

77
00:05:45,518 --> 00:05:46,605
Because it's always you.

78
00:09:09,865 --> 00:09:12,366
- Couldn't stop him.
- Neither could I.

79
00:09:15,829 --> 00:09:17,094
I lost the kid.

80
00:09:19,831 --> 00:09:21,768
Tony, we lost.

81
00:09:23,951 --> 00:09:25,514
Is, umm...

82
00:09:26,281 --> 00:09:27,727
Oh, my God!

83
00:09:34,894 --> 00:09:36,069
It's okay.

84
00:09:42,873 --> 00:09:45,522
It's been 23 days since
Thanos came to Earth.

85
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:50,212
World governments are in pieces.

86
00:09:50,237 --> 00:09:53,864
The parts that are still working
are trying to take a census,

87
00:09:53,872 --> 00:09:55,786
And it looks like he did...

88
00:09:58,827 --> 00:10:02,384
He did exactly what he said he
was gonna do. Thanos wiped out..

89
00:10:04,225 --> 00:10:06,973
...fifty percent of
all living creatures.

90
00:10:11,443 --> 00:10:13,139
Where is he now? Where?

91
00:10:13,795 --> 00:10:15,023
We don't know.

92
00:10:15,608 --> 00:10:18,477
He just opened a portal
and walked through.

93
00:10:21,097 --> 00:10:22,565
What's wrong with him?

94
00:10:23,105 --> 00:10:24,521
He's pissed.

95
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:27,160
He thinks he failed.

96
00:10:28,175 --> 00:10:31,411
Which of course he did, but there's a
lot of that goin' around, ain't there?

97
00:10:31,584 --> 00:10:34,793
Honestly, at this exact second, I
thought you were a Build-A-Bear.

98
00:10:34,818 --> 00:10:35,782
Maybe I am.

99
00:10:35,807 --> 00:10:37,745
We've been hunting Thanos
for three weeks now.

100
00:10:37,876 --> 00:10:41,472
Deep space scans, and
satellites, and we got nothing.

101
00:10:43,648 --> 00:10:46,118
- Tony you fought him.
- Who told you that?

102
00:10:46,258 --> 00:10:47,259
Didn't fight him.

103
00:10:47,337 --> 00:10:49,579
No. He wiped my face
with a planet while a

104
00:10:49,604 --> 00:10:51,950
Bleecker Street magician
gave away the stone.

105
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:53,818
- That's what happened. There was no fight...
- Okay.

106
00:10:54,618 --> 00:10:57,306
Did he give you any clues?
Any coordinates, anything?

107
00:10:58,245 --> 00:10:59,246
Pfft!

108
00:10:59,996 --> 00:11:03,529
I saw this coming a few years back. I had
a vision. I didn't wanna believe it.

109
00:11:04,107 --> 00:11:05,545
Thought I was dreaming.

110
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:08,414
- Tony I'm gonna need you to focus.
- And I needed you.

111
00:11:08,712 --> 00:11:12,831
As in past tense. That trumps what
you need. It's too late, buddy.

112
00:11:13,199 --> 00:11:14,200
Sorry.

113
00:11:15,317 --> 00:11:17,920
You know what I need?
I need to shave.

114
00:11:18,727 --> 00:11:22,220
- And I believe I rememeber telling
- Tony, Tony, Tony...

115
00:11:22,283 --> 00:11:24,168
why that otherwise,

116
00:11:24,193 --> 00:11:28,650
that what we needed was a suit of armor
around the world. Remember that?

117
00:11:28,675 --> 00:11:33,123
Whether it impacted our precious
freedoms, or not. That's what we needed.

118
00:11:33,148 --> 00:11:35,689
- Well that didn't work out, did it?
- I said we'd lose.

119
00:11:35,802 --> 00:11:38,679
You said, "We'll do
that together, too."

120
00:11:38,735 --> 00:11:41,368
Well guess what, Cap? We lost.

121
00:11:41,407 --> 00:11:43,808
You weren't there.

122
00:11:44,401 --> 00:11:47,223
But that's what we do, right?
Our best work after the fact?

123
00:11:47,248 --> 00:11:50,491
We're the Avengers? We're the Avengers?
Not the Prevengers?

124
00:11:50,515 --> 00:11:53,213
Okay. You made your point.
Just sit down, okay?

125
00:11:53,315 --> 00:11:55,886
- No, no. Here's my... She's great, by the way.
- Tony, sit, sit down!

126
00:11:55,934 --> 00:11:58,342
We need you. You're new blood.
Bunch of tired old mills...

127
00:11:58,380 --> 00:12:01,862
I got nothing for you, Cap.
I got no coordinates,

128
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,798
no clues, no strategies,
no options...

129
00:12:04,823 --> 00:12:08,782
Zero. Zip. Nada. No
trust, you liar...

130
00:12:13,145 --> 00:12:16,154
Here, take this. You find
him and you put that on.

131
00:12:17,032 --> 00:12:18,297
You hide.

132
00:12:19,863 --> 00:12:22,840
- Tony!
- I'm fine. I...

133
00:12:30,175 --> 00:12:33,959
Bruce gave him a sedative. He's gonna
probably be out for the rest of the day.

134
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,680
You guys take care of him. And I'll bring
an Bezurian elixir when I come back.

135
00:12:38,329 --> 00:12:40,806
- Where are you going?
- To kill Thanos.

136
00:12:44,153 --> 00:12:44,793
Hey.

137
00:12:45,457 --> 00:12:47,538
You know we usually work
as a team here, and

138
00:12:47,587 --> 00:12:49,538
between you and I we're
also a little fragile.

139
00:12:49,578 --> 00:12:53,166
We realize up there is more your
territory but this is our fight, too.

140
00:12:53,198 --> 00:12:55,714
- You even know where he is?
- I know people who might.

141
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,512
Don't bother.

142
00:12:58,098 --> 00:13:00,434
I can tell you where Thanos is.

143
00:13:02,609 --> 00:13:05,353
Thanos spent a long time
trying to perfect me.

144
00:13:06,086 --> 00:13:09,854
Then when he worked, he
talked about his great plan.

145
00:13:10,237 --> 00:13:12,833
Even disassembled, I
wanted to please him.

146
00:13:13,388 --> 00:13:17,586
I'd ask, where would we go
once his plan was complete?

147
00:13:18,704 --> 00:13:20,772
His answer was always the same.

148
00:13:24,944 --> 00:13:26,070
To The Garden.

149
00:13:26,328 --> 00:13:29,361
That's cute. Thanos has
a retirement plan.

150
00:13:29,386 --> 00:13:31,035
So where is he, then?

151
00:13:31,098 --> 00:13:32,847
When Thanos snapped his fingers,

152
00:13:32,872 --> 00:13:37,406
Earth became ground zero for a power surge
of ridiculously cosmic proportions.

153
00:13:37,453 --> 00:13:41,737
No one's ever seen anything like it...
until two days ago.

154
00:13:42,871 --> 00:13:45,168
On this planet.

155
00:13:45,498 --> 00:13:46,841
Thanos is there.

156
00:13:48,624 --> 00:13:50,156
He used the stones again.

157
00:13:50,492 --> 00:13:51,560
Hey, hey, hey...

158
00:13:52,361 --> 00:13:54,615
We'd be going in
short-handed, you know?

159
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:57,094
- Look, he still got the stones, so...
- So let's get him.

160
00:13:57,572 --> 00:14:00,267
- We use them to bring everyone back.
- Just like that?

161
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:02,259
Yeah. Just like that.

162
00:14:02,284 --> 00:14:05,441
Even if there's a small chance
that we can undo this...

163
00:14:05,466 --> 00:14:08,224
I mean, we owe it to everyone
who's not in this room to try.

164
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:12,494
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna
end any differently than it did before?

165
00:14:12,539 --> 00:14:14,680
Because before, you
didn't have me.

166
00:14:15,008 --> 00:14:19,229
Hey, new girl, everybody in this
room is about that superhero life.

167
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:22,188
And if you don't mind my asking, where
the hell have you been all this time?

168
00:14:22,213 --> 00:14:24,761
There are a lot of other
planets in the universe.

169
00:14:24,786 --> 00:14:27,608
And unfortunately, they
didn't have you guys.

170
00:14:47,076 --> 00:14:48,357
I like this one.

171
00:14:53,704 --> 00:14:56,323
Let's go get this
son of a bitch.

172
00:15:17,998 --> 00:15:21,789
Okay. Who here hasn't
been to space?

173
00:15:24,188 --> 00:15:26,416
You better not throw
up on my ship.

174
00:15:26,549 --> 00:15:30,012
Approaching jump in 3.. 2.. 1.

175
00:15:43,580 --> 00:15:45,863
I'll head down for recon.

176
00:16:03,777 --> 00:16:06,622
- This is gonna work Steve.
- I know it will.

177
00:16:10,607 --> 00:16:13,234
Because I don't know what
I'm gonna do if it doesn't.

178
00:16:13,476 --> 00:16:19,081
No satellites, no ships, no armies,
no ground defenses of any kind.

179
00:16:20,644 --> 00:16:21,957
It's just him.

180
00:16:22,966 --> 00:16:24,717
Then that's enough.

181
00:17:54,201 --> 00:17:55,474
Oh, no.

182
00:18:05,314 --> 00:18:06,650
Where are they?

183
00:18:06,893 --> 00:18:09,332
Answer the question.

184
00:18:10,833 --> 00:18:13,638
The universe
required correction.

185
00:18:13,734 --> 00:18:19,006
After that, the stones served
no purpose, beyond temptation.

186
00:18:19,077 --> 00:18:20,851
You murdered trillions!

187
00:18:22,124 --> 00:18:23,812
You should be grateful.

188
00:18:27,714 --> 00:18:30,770
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.

189
00:18:31,353 --> 00:18:34,856
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.

190
00:18:34,934 --> 00:18:38,061
I used the stones to
destroy the stones.

191
00:18:38,827 --> 00:18:41,547
It nearly killed me.

192
00:18:41,743 --> 00:18:45,878
But the work is done.
It always will be.

193
00:18:48,422 --> 00:18:51,806
I am inevitable.

194
00:18:53,854 --> 00:18:56,395
We have to tear this place apart.
He has to be lying.

195
00:18:56,419 --> 00:18:58,086
My father is many things.

196
00:18:58,521 --> 00:19:01,085
A liar is not one of them.

197
00:19:04,605 --> 00:19:07,090
Thank you, Daughter.

198
00:19:08,652 --> 00:19:11,234
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...

199
00:19:17,395 --> 00:19:20,584
What... what did you do?

200
00:19:22,358 --> 00:19:24,399
I went for the head.

201
00:20:35,121 --> 00:20:36,442
So I, uh...

202
00:20:38,131 --> 00:20:40,264
Went on a date the other day.

203
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:45,211
It's the first time in five years,
you know? Sit there, dinner...

204
00:20:45,493 --> 00:20:48,096
I didn't know what
to talk about.

205
00:20:50,020 --> 00:20:51,621
What did you talk about?

206
00:20:51,662 --> 00:20:54,898
Same old crap, you know? How
things have changed, and...

207
00:20:55,695 --> 00:20:57,196
My job, his job...

208
00:20:57,681 --> 00:21:00,143
How much we miss the Mets.

209
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:04,116
Then things get quiet..

210
00:21:06,062 --> 00:21:09,376
He cried as they were
serving the salads.

211
00:21:09,970 --> 00:21:11,330
What about you?

212
00:21:12,675 --> 00:21:15,669
I cried just before dessert.

213
00:21:19,257 --> 00:21:22,259
But I'm seeing him
again tomorrow, so...

214
00:21:22,259 --> 00:21:23,478
That's great.

215
00:21:23,510 --> 00:21:25,465
You did the hardest part.
You took the jump, you

216
00:21:25,490 --> 00:21:27,583
didn't know where you
were gonna come down.

217
00:21:28,067 --> 00:21:32,537
And that's it. That's those little
brave baby steps you gotta take.

218
00:21:32,547 --> 00:21:36,135
To try and become whole again.
To try and find purpose.

219
00:21:38,207 --> 00:21:41,740
I went in the ice in '45 right
after I met the love of my life.

220
00:21:43,178 --> 00:21:45,102
Woke up 70 years later.

221
00:21:47,838 --> 00:21:49,143
You got to move on.

222
00:21:52,662 --> 00:21:53,968
Got to move on.

223
00:21:59,269 --> 00:22:01,223
The world is in our hands.

224
00:22:01,544 --> 00:22:03,498
It's left to us guys.

225
00:22:03,662 --> 00:22:06,289
And we got to do
something with it.

226
00:22:06,938 --> 00:22:08,258
Otherwise...

227
00:22:09,530 --> 00:22:12,219
Thanos should've
killed all of us.

228
00:23:13,635 --> 00:23:15,612
What the hell?

229
00:23:27,427 --> 00:23:28,475
Hope?

230
00:24:02,053 --> 00:24:04,391
Kid! Hey, kid!

231
00:24:08,537 --> 00:24:10,851
What the hell happened here?

232
00:24:42,757 --> 00:24:43,836
My God...

233
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:51,567
No. Please. Please, please.
No, no, no...

234
00:24:57,617 --> 00:25:00,306
Excuse me. Sorry.
No, Cassie, no.

235
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,861
No.

236
00:25:02,886 --> 00:25:03,886
No, no.

237
00:25:05,620 --> 00:25:07,536
Please, please,
please, please...

238
00:25:07,561 --> 00:25:08,561
No, Cassie...

239
00:25:15,808 --> 00:25:16,809
What?

240
00:25:46,942 --> 00:25:48,232
Cassie?

241
00:25:49,530 --> 00:25:50,530
Dad?

242
00:26:16,964 --> 00:26:18,402
You're so big!

243
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:36,978
Yeah, we boarded that highly
suspect warship Danvers pinged.

244
00:26:37,003 --> 00:26:39,059
It was an infectious
garbage scowl.

245
00:26:39,084 --> 00:26:40,591
So, thanks for the hot tip.

246
00:26:40,725 --> 00:26:43,452
- Well, you were closer.
- Yeah. And now we smell like garbage.

247
00:26:43,477 --> 00:26:45,350
You get a reading
on those tremors?

248
00:26:45,375 --> 00:26:47,869
It was a mild subduction
under the African plate.

249
00:26:47,988 --> 00:26:50,403
Do we have a visual? How
are we handling it?

250
00:26:50,434 --> 00:26:53,671
Nat, it's an earthquake
under the ocean.

251
00:26:53,703 --> 00:26:56,672
We handle it by not handling it.

252
00:26:57,454 --> 00:26:59,854
Carol, are we seeing
you here next month?

253
00:26:59,883 --> 00:27:02,934
- Not likely.
- What, you gonna get another haircut?

254
00:27:02,979 --> 00:27:06,597
Listen, fur-face. I'm
covering a lot of territory.

255
00:27:06,622 --> 00:27:08,498
The things that are
happening on Earth are

256
00:27:08,523 --> 00:27:11,391
happening everywhere, on
thousands of planets.

257
00:27:12,120 --> 00:27:14,089
That's a good point.
That's a good point.

258
00:27:14,762 --> 00:27:17,444
So you might not see
me for a long time.

259
00:27:17,666 --> 00:27:19,608
All right. Uh, well...

260
00:27:20,248 --> 00:27:24,555
This channel is always active.
So, anything goes sideways...

261
00:27:24,626 --> 00:27:27,049
Anyone's making trouble
where they shouldn't...

262
00:27:27,315 --> 00:27:30,199
- Comes through me.
- Okay.

263
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,216
All right.

264
00:27:32,338 --> 00:27:33,639
Good luck.

265
00:27:41,984 --> 00:27:44,329
- Where are you?
- Mexico.

266
00:27:44,382 --> 00:27:47,339
The federales found a
room full of bodies.

267
00:27:47,582 --> 00:27:51,169
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys. Never
even had the chance to get their guns off.

268
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:54,609
- It's probably a rival gang...
- Except it isn't.

269
00:27:54,634 --> 00:27:57,016
It's definitely Barton.

270
00:27:57,159 --> 00:28:01,529
What he's done here, what he's
been doing for the last few years,

271
00:28:03,122 --> 00:28:05,185
I mean, the scene
that he left...

272
00:28:05,756 --> 00:28:09,063
I gotta tell you, there's a part of
me that doesn't even wanna find him.

273
00:28:14,899 --> 00:28:17,235
Will you find out where
he's going next?

274
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,201
Nat...

275
00:28:23,762 --> 00:28:24,967
Please.

276
00:28:27,600 --> 00:28:28,601
Okay.

277
00:28:37,420 --> 00:28:41,492
You know I'd offer to clip your dinner
but you seem pretty miserable already.

278
00:28:45,262 --> 00:28:46,652
You here to do your laundry?

279
00:28:46,677 --> 00:28:48,599
And to see a friend.

280
00:28:49,484 --> 00:28:51,422
Clearly, your friend is fine.

281
00:28:54,757 --> 00:28:57,382
You know I saw a pod of whales
when I was coming up the bridge.

282
00:28:57,407 --> 00:29:00,526
- In the Hudson?
- There's fewer ships, cleaner water.

283
00:29:00,534 --> 00:29:04,591
You know, if you're about to tell
me to look on the bright side...

284
00:29:05,136 --> 00:29:06,137
Um...

285
00:29:07,247 --> 00:29:11,007
I'm about to hit you in the head
with a peanut butter sandwich.

286
00:29:12,907 --> 00:29:15,744
Sorry. Force of habit.

287
00:29:29,607 --> 00:29:33,819
You know I keep telling everybody
they should move on and... grow.

288
00:29:35,969 --> 00:29:37,102
Some do.

289
00:29:40,675 --> 00:29:41,847
But not us.

290
00:29:42,713 --> 00:29:47,036
- If I move on, who does this?
- Maybe it doesn't need to be done.

291
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:53,643
I used to have nothing.

292
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:56,872
And then I got this.

293
00:29:59,170 --> 00:30:00,460
This job.

294
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:04,619
This family.

295
00:30:08,804 --> 00:30:12,485
And I was... I was
better because of it.

296
00:30:18,999 --> 00:30:20,311
And even though...

297
00:30:21,377 --> 00:30:22,846
they're gone...

298
00:30:26,498 --> 00:30:28,780
Now, I'm still
trying to be better.

299
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:34,146
I think we both
need to get a life.

300
00:30:36,993 --> 00:30:38,234
You first.

301
00:30:43,426 --> 00:30:44,848
Oh... Hi. Hi!

302
00:30:44,872 --> 00:30:47,816
Is anyone home?
This is Scott Lang.

303
00:30:47,841 --> 00:30:52,492
We met a few years ago, at the airport?
In Germany?

304
00:30:52,524 --> 00:30:55,385
I got really big and
I had my mask on.

305
00:30:55,410 --> 00:30:57,331
- You wouldn't recognize me.
- Is this an old message?

306
00:30:57,356 --> 00:31:00,288
Ant-Man? Ant-Man, I
know you know that.

307
00:31:00,374 --> 00:31:01,398
It's the front gate.

308
00:31:01,429 --> 00:31:03,230
I need to talk to you guys.

309
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:10,099
Scott.

310
00:31:11,443 --> 00:31:13,451
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

311
00:31:15,116 --> 00:31:17,673
Have either of you guys ever
studied quantum physics?

312
00:31:18,002 --> 00:31:20,119
Only in mid-conversation.

313
00:31:20,307 --> 00:31:21,308
Alright. So...

314
00:31:22,412 --> 00:31:27,070
Five years ago, right before...
Thanos,

315
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:29,409
I was in a place called
the quantum realm.

316
00:31:29,581 --> 00:31:32,450
The quantum realm is like its
own microscopic universe.

317
00:31:32,475 --> 00:31:36,016
To get in there, you have to be
incredibly small. Hope, she's my...

318
00:31:37,853 --> 00:31:39,370
She... she was my...

319
00:31:41,411 --> 00:31:45,115
She was supposed to pull me out.
And then Thanos happened, and

320
00:31:45,140 --> 00:31:48,813
- I got stuck in there.
- Sorry. That must've been a long 5 years.

321
00:31:48,839 --> 00:31:51,511
Yeah, but that's just it.
It wasn't.

322
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,254
For me it was five hours.

323
00:31:53,279 --> 00:31:55,844
See, the rules of the quantum realm
aren't like they are up here.

324
00:31:55,890 --> 00:32:00,322
Everything is unpredictable. Is that
anybody's sandwich? I'm starving.

325
00:32:00,635 --> 00:32:01,636
Scott.

326
00:32:01,722 --> 00:32:03,613
What are you talking about?

327
00:32:03,705 --> 00:32:04,706
So...

328
00:32:05,824 --> 00:32:07,606
What I'm saying is...

329
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:10,676
Time works differently
in the quantum realm.

330
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:12,944
The only problem is right now, we
don't have a way to navigate it.

331
00:32:12,985 --> 00:32:14,329
But what if we did?

332
00:32:14,377 --> 00:32:18,104
I can't stop thinking about it. What
if we could somehow control the chaos,

333
00:32:18,129 --> 00:32:21,613
and we could navigate it? What if
there was a way that we can enter

334
00:32:21,638 --> 00:32:24,085
the quantum realm at a certain
point in time but then

335
00:32:24,110 --> 00:32:27,212
exit the quantum realm at
another point in time? Like...

336
00:32:28,492 --> 00:32:30,094
Like before Thanos.

337
00:32:30,297 --> 00:32:32,585
Wait, are you talking
about a time machine?

338
00:32:32,610 --> 00:32:35,732
No. No, of course not.
No, not a time machine.

339
00:32:35,881 --> 00:32:37,937
It's more like a...

340
00:32:39,170 --> 00:32:42,679
Yeah, a time machine. I know it's crazy.
It's crazy.

341
00:32:43,243 --> 00:32:46,612
But I can't stop thinking about it.
There's gotta be...

342
00:32:46,987 --> 00:32:49,828
Some wa... It's crazy.

343
00:32:49,853 --> 00:32:53,801
I get e-mails from a raccoon. So,
nothing sounds crazy anymore.

344
00:32:54,606 --> 00:32:56,686
So who do we talk to about this?

345
00:33:14,750 --> 00:33:15,750
Chow-time!

346
00:33:18,214 --> 00:33:19,215
Morgoona.

347
00:33:23,710 --> 00:33:25,922
Morgan H. Stark.
Want some lunch?

348
00:33:26,102 --> 00:33:29,002
- Define lunch or be disintegrated.
- Okay.

349
00:33:30,011 --> 00:33:31,362
You should not be
wearing that, okay?

350
00:33:31,387 --> 00:33:34,270
That is part of a special anniversary
gift I'm making for Mom.

351
00:33:37,663 --> 00:33:39,867
There you go. Are you
thinking about lunch?

352
00:33:40,383 --> 00:33:42,540
Want a handful of crickets?

353
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:44,447
- No.
- That's what you want.

354
00:33:44,472 --> 00:33:47,888
- How did you find this?
- Garage.

355
00:33:47,924 --> 00:33:48,697
Really?

356
00:33:48,722 --> 00:33:51,082
- Were you looking for it?
- No.

357
00:33:51,605 --> 00:33:53,278
I found it, though.

358
00:33:53,567 --> 00:33:56,795
You like going to the garage, huh?
So does Daddy.

359
00:33:57,828 --> 00:34:00,778
It's fine actually. Mom never
wears anything I wear.

360
00:34:22,237 --> 00:34:24,571
Now, we know what
it sounds like...

361
00:34:24,644 --> 00:34:26,598
Tony after everything you've seen,
is anything really impossible...

362
00:34:26,622 --> 00:34:29,012
Quantum fluctuation messes
with the Planck scale,

363
00:34:29,037 --> 00:34:32,047
which then triggers the Deutsch
proposition. Can we agree on that?

364
00:34:32,204 --> 00:34:33,204
Thank you.

365
00:34:33,243 --> 00:34:35,901
In Layman's terms, it means
you're not coming home.

366
00:34:35,926 --> 00:34:36,927
- I did.
- No.

367
00:34:36,965 --> 00:34:38,962
You accidentally survived. It's a...

368
00:34:39,009 --> 00:34:41,519
It's a billion-to-one
cosmic fluke.

369
00:34:41,587 --> 00:34:43,355
And now you wanna pull a...

370
00:34:43,510 --> 00:34:44,979
What do you call it?

371
00:34:46,698 --> 00:34:49,410
- A time heist?
- Yeah. Time heist.

372
00:34:49,684 --> 00:34:51,853
Of course. Why didn't we
think of this before?

373
00:34:51,878 --> 00:34:54,370
Oh! Because it's laughable?
Because it's a pipedream?

374
00:34:54,395 --> 00:34:57,843
The stones are in the past. We
can go back and we can get them.

375
00:34:57,868 --> 00:35:00,375
We can snap our own fingers.
We can bring everybody back.

376
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,543
Or screw it up worse than
he already has, right?

377
00:35:02,583 --> 00:35:03,809
I don't believe we would.

378
00:35:03,934 --> 00:35:07,248
Gotta say this. Sometimes, I
miss that giddy optimism.

379
00:35:07,528 --> 00:35:10,545
However, high hopes won't
help if there's no logical,

380
00:35:10,570 --> 00:35:14,869
tangible, way for me to safely
execute said time heist.

381
00:35:15,362 --> 00:35:17,991
I believe the most likely outcome
will be our collective demise.

382
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:21,025
Not if we strictly follow
the rules of time travel.

383
00:35:21,252 --> 00:35:25,200
That means no talking to our past selves,
no betting on sporting events...

384
00:35:25,232 --> 00:35:27,764
I'm gonna stop you
right there, Scott.

385
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:30,390
Are you seriously telling
me that your plan to

386
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:33,517
save the universe is based
on Back to the Future?

387
00:35:35,462 --> 00:35:37,541
- No.
- Good. You had me worried there.

388
00:35:37,563 --> 00:35:40,838
'Cause that'd be horseshit. That's
not how quantum physics works.

389
00:35:41,091 --> 00:35:42,092
Tony...

390
00:35:44,093 --> 00:35:45,985
We have to take a stand.

391
00:35:46,384 --> 00:35:49,136
We did stand. And
yet, here we are.

392
00:35:50,574 --> 00:35:54,342
I know you got a lot on the line.
You got a wife, a daughter.

393
00:35:55,179 --> 00:35:59,432
But I lost someone very important to me.
A lot of people did.

394
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:03,909
And now, now, we have a chance to bring
her back. To bring everyone back.

395
00:36:03,934 --> 00:36:05,536
And you're telling me
that you won't even...

396
00:36:05,561 --> 00:36:07,569
That's right, Scott.
I won't. Leave it.

397
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:10,797
Got a kid.

398
00:36:12,643 --> 00:36:14,894
Mommy told me to
come and save you.

399
00:36:14,919 --> 00:36:17,567
Good job. I'm saved.

400
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:20,311
I wish you'd come here to
ask me something else.

401
00:36:20,327 --> 00:36:23,242
Anything else. Honestly, I
missed you guys, it was...

402
00:36:23,321 --> 00:36:26,432
- Oh, and table's set for six.
- Tony, I get it.

403
00:36:26,549 --> 00:36:28,940
And I'm happy for you.
I really am.

404
00:36:29,559 --> 00:36:31,520
But this is a second chance.

405
00:36:31,818 --> 00:36:34,257
I got my second chance
right here, Cap.

406
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:36,474
I can't roll the dice again.

407
00:36:37,964 --> 00:36:40,669
If you don't talk shop,
you can stay for lunch.

408
00:36:43,422 --> 00:36:45,995
- He's scared.
- He's not wrong.

409
00:36:46,213 --> 00:36:48,440
Yeah, but I mean,
what are we gonna do?

410
00:36:48,574 --> 00:36:50,707
We need him. What,
are we gonna stop?

411
00:36:50,732 --> 00:36:52,639
No. I wanna do it right.

412
00:36:55,912 --> 00:36:58,094
We're gonna need a
really big brain.

413
00:36:58,445 --> 00:37:00,172
Bigger than his?

414
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:03,353
Come on. I feel like I'm the only
one eating. Try some of that.

415
00:37:03,378 --> 00:37:04,612
Have some eggs.

416
00:37:04,878 --> 00:37:06,160
I'm so confused.

417
00:37:06,188 --> 00:37:08,838
- These are confusing times.
- Right. No, no...

418
00:37:08,862 --> 00:37:11,746
- That's not what I meant. I...
- No, I get it.

419
00:37:11,771 --> 00:37:15,179
I'm kidding! I know. It's crazy.

420
00:37:15,304 --> 00:37:19,577
- I'm wearing shirts now.
- Yeah! How? Why?

421
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:22,267
Five years ago we
got our asses beat.

422
00:37:22,736 --> 00:37:25,645
Except it was worse for me.
Because I lost twice.

423
00:37:25,888 --> 00:37:29,990
First, Hulk lost. Then Banner lost.
Then, we all lost.

424
00:37:30,015 --> 00:37:32,861
- No one blamed you, Bruce.
- I did.

425
00:37:34,428 --> 00:37:36,297
For years I've been
treating the Hulk like he's

426
00:37:36,322 --> 00:37:38,760
some kind of disease,
something to get rid of.

427
00:37:39,535 --> 00:37:42,418
But then I started looking
at him as the cure.

428
00:37:42,486 --> 00:37:47,543
Eighteen months in a gamma lab. I put
the brains and the brawn together.

429
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:51,459
And now look at me.
Best of both worlds.

430
00:37:51,666 --> 00:37:53,745
- Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
- Yes?

431
00:37:53,770 --> 00:37:57,381
- Can we get a photo?
- 100%, little person.

432
00:37:57,429 --> 00:38:00,227
Come on, step on up. You mind?

433
00:38:00,252 --> 00:38:01,253
Oh.

434
00:38:01,934 --> 00:38:04,561
- Say "green."
- Green.

435
00:38:04,586 --> 00:38:06,241
Greeeen.

436
00:38:06,266 --> 00:38:08,971
- Did you get that?
- That's good.

437
00:38:09,299 --> 00:38:12,309
Don't you wanna grab one with me?
I'm Ant-Man.

438
00:38:15,084 --> 00:38:16,739
They're Hulk fans.
They don't know Ant-Man.

439
00:38:16,764 --> 00:38:18,952
- Nobody does.
- Wait, no, no, he wants to...

440
00:38:18,977 --> 00:38:21,501
You want to take a
picture with him, right?

441
00:38:21,526 --> 00:38:23,644
He's even saying no he doesn't.
I get it.

442
00:38:23,669 --> 00:38:26,630
I don't want it either. I don't
want a picture with them.

443
00:38:26,632 --> 00:38:28,539
- He's gonna feel bad.
- Sorry.

444
00:38:28,570 --> 00:38:30,916
- They said they'd do it.
- I don't want it anymore.

445
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,449
- You'd feel bad...
- Take the goddamn phone.

446
00:38:34,566 --> 00:38:35,500
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.

447
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:37,803
No, it's great, kids.
Thank you very much.

448
00:38:38,117 --> 00:38:40,274
- Hulk out!
- Bruce.

449
00:38:41,050 --> 00:38:42,502
- Dab.
- Bruce.

450
00:38:42,527 --> 00:38:45,231
Listen to your Mom.
She knows better.

451
00:38:45,256 --> 00:38:48,225
- About we were saying...
- Right.

452
00:38:50,138 --> 00:38:52,842
The whole time travel do-over?

453
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:57,439
Guys, it's outside of
my area of expertise.

454
00:38:58,518 --> 00:39:00,401
Well, you pulled this off.

455
00:39:00,754 --> 00:39:04,209
I remember a time when that
seemed pretty impossible, too.

456
00:39:37,736 --> 00:39:40,441
Look at a mod inspiration,
let me see what checks out.

457
00:39:40,727 --> 00:39:44,597
So, recommend one last sim before
we pack it in for the night.

458
00:39:44,621 --> 00:39:49,225
This time, in the shape of a
mobius strip, inverted. Please?

459
00:39:49,250 --> 00:39:50,883
Processing...

460
00:39:54,049 --> 00:39:58,385
Give me that eigenvalue. That, particle
factoring, and spectral decomp.

461
00:39:58,410 --> 00:40:01,108
- Gotta take a second.
- Just a moment.

462
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:04,757
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out.
I'm just kinda...

463
00:40:05,921 --> 00:40:08,032
Model rendered.

464
00:40:19,284 --> 00:40:20,285
Shit!

465
00:40:20,635 --> 00:40:21,636
Shit!

466
00:40:25,854 --> 00:40:27,761
What are you doing
up, Little Miss?

467
00:40:27,816 --> 00:40:29,621
- Shit.
- No. We don't say that.

468
00:40:29,661 --> 00:40:32,889
Only Mommy says that word. She
coined it, it belongs to her.

469
00:40:32,897 --> 00:40:33,939
Why you up?

470
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:36,591
'Cause I got some important shit
going on here. What do you think?

471
00:40:36,616 --> 00:40:39,755
No, I got something on my mind.
I got something on my mind.

472
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:43,767
- Was it Juice Pops?
- Sure was.

473
00:40:45,506 --> 00:40:47,647
That's extortion.

474
00:40:48,664 --> 00:40:52,517
Great minds think alike. Juice
Pops, exactly was on...

475
00:40:54,042 --> 00:40:55,394
my mind.

476
00:40:56,216 --> 00:40:59,389
You done? Yeah? Now you are.

477
00:41:04,744 --> 00:41:07,832
- That face, goes there.
- Tell me a story.

478
00:41:08,099 --> 00:41:09,701
A story.

479
00:41:09,975 --> 00:41:12,508
Once upon a time, a little
girl went to bed. The end.

480
00:41:12,547 --> 00:41:13,878
That ain't the whole story.

481
00:41:13,903 --> 00:41:16,154
Come on, that's your
favorite story.

482
00:41:16,238 --> 00:41:17,707
I love you tons.

483
00:41:19,428 --> 00:41:21,952
I love you 3,000.

484
00:41:22,860 --> 00:41:23,860
Wow.

485
00:41:31,001 --> 00:41:34,026
3,000. That's crazy.

486
00:41:34,864 --> 00:41:37,398
Go to bed. Or I'll
sell all your toys.

487
00:41:37,732 --> 00:41:38,928
Night-night.

488
00:41:39,702 --> 00:41:43,376
Not that it's a competition,
but she loves me 3,000.

489
00:41:44,174 --> 00:41:48,074
You were somewhere in
the low 6 to 900 range.

490
00:41:53,715 --> 00:41:57,757
- What you reading?
- Just a book on composting.

491
00:41:57,782 --> 00:42:00,000
What's new with composting?

492
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:02,901
- Just...
- I figured it out...

493
00:42:03,910 --> 00:42:05,379
by the way.

494
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:09,161
You know, just so we're talking
about the same thing...

495
00:42:09,608 --> 00:42:10,991
Time travel.

496
00:42:12,124 --> 00:42:13,125
What?

497
00:42:16,589 --> 00:42:17,590
Wow.

498
00:42:19,889 --> 00:42:20,889
That's...

499
00:42:21,663 --> 00:42:25,392
Amazing, and... terrifying.

500
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:26,635
That's right.

501
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:38,544
- I got really lucky.
- Yeah. I know.

502
00:42:38,614 --> 00:42:41,741
- A lot of people didn't.
- No, I can't help everybody.

503
00:42:43,027 --> 00:42:45,982
- It sorta seems like you can.
- Not if I stop.

504
00:42:47,530 --> 00:42:50,727
I can put a pin in it
right now, and stop.

505
00:42:51,086 --> 00:42:52,353
Tony...

506
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:57,974
trying to get you to stop has been one
of the few failures of my entire life.

507
00:43:01,847 --> 00:43:07,467
I sometimes feel I should put it in a locked
box and drop it at the bottom of a lake...

508
00:43:08,218 --> 00:43:10,062
...go to bed.

509
00:43:15,795 --> 00:43:18,305
But would you be able to rest?

510
00:43:22,807 --> 00:43:25,894
Okay, here we go. Time
travel test number one.

511
00:43:26,114 --> 00:43:30,812
Scott, fire up the, uhh...
The van thing.

512
00:43:32,721 --> 00:43:36,217
Breakers are set. Emergency
generators are on standby.

513
00:43:36,248 --> 00:43:41,095
Good. 'Cause if we blow the grid, I don't
wanna lose Tiny here in the 1950's.

514
00:43:41,189 --> 00:43:43,510
- Excuse me?
- He's kidding.

515
00:43:43,776 --> 00:43:45,596
You can't say things like that.

516
00:43:45,621 --> 00:43:48,724
Just... it was, just a bad joke.

517
00:43:50,077 --> 00:43:52,351
- You were kidding, right?
- I have no idea.

518
00:43:52,428 --> 00:43:56,571
We're talking about time travel here.
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is.

519
00:43:56,930 --> 00:43:59,744
We're good! Get your helmet on.

520
00:44:00,456 --> 00:44:03,184
Scott, I'm gonna send you
back a week, but you'll walk

521
00:44:03,209 --> 00:44:06,210
around for an hour, then bring
you back in 10 seconds.

522
00:44:06,390 --> 00:44:08,837
- Makes sense?
- Perfectly not confusing.

523
00:44:08,862 --> 00:44:11,465
Good luck, Scott. You got this.

524
00:44:12,441 --> 00:44:16,220
You're right. I do,
Captain America.

525
00:44:17,877 --> 00:44:23,724
On the count of three.
3.. 2.. 1..

526
00:44:27,482 --> 00:44:30,765
Guys? This doesn't feel right.

527
00:44:30,905 --> 00:44:32,774
- What's going on? Hold on.
- Who is that?

528
00:44:32,799 --> 00:44:34,808
- Is that Scott?
- Yes, it's Scott!

529
00:44:37,884 --> 00:44:39,596
Ooh! My back!

530
00:44:42,164 --> 00:44:44,607
- Can you bring him back?
- I'm working on it!

531
00:44:51,549 --> 00:44:52,549
A baby.

532
00:44:52,575 --> 00:44:54,161
- It's Scott.
- As a baby!

533
00:44:54,831 --> 00:44:55,888
Bring Scott back.

534
00:44:55,913 --> 00:44:58,209
When I say kill the
power, kill the power.

535
00:44:59,421 --> 00:45:01,492
And... kill it!

536
00:45:04,944 --> 00:45:07,335
Somebody peed my pants.

537
00:45:08,594 --> 00:45:11,603
I don't know if it was
"baby" me or "old" me.

538
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:16,977
Or, just "me" me.

539
00:45:17,032 --> 00:45:18,861
Time travel!

540
00:45:22,387 --> 00:45:23,388
What?

541
00:45:24,732 --> 00:45:27,530
I see this as an absolute win.

542
00:46:12,760 --> 00:46:13,964
Why the long face?

543
00:46:14,027 --> 00:46:15,957
Let me guess. He
turned into a baby.

544
00:46:16,984 --> 00:46:19,172
Among other things, yeah.
What are you doing here?

545
00:46:19,235 --> 00:46:21,197
That's the EPR paradox.

546
00:46:21,393 --> 00:46:25,044
Instead of pushing Lang through time, you
might've wound up pushing time through Lang.

547
00:46:25,069 --> 00:46:28,022
It's tricky. Dangerous. Somebody
coulda cautioned you against it.

548
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:30,455
- You did.
- Oh, did I?

549
00:46:31,178 --> 00:46:35,759
Thank God, I'm here.
Regardless, I fixed it.

550
00:46:35,784 --> 00:46:38,206
A fully functioning
time-space GPS.

551
00:46:40,228 --> 00:46:42,296
I just want peace.

552
00:46:42,839 --> 00:46:46,130
Turns out, resentment is
corrosive, and I hate it.

553
00:46:46,645 --> 00:46:47,966
Me, too.

554
00:46:49,231 --> 00:46:51,066
We got a shot at getting
these stones, but I

555
00:46:51,091 --> 00:46:52,843
gotta tell you my
priority is to bring back

556
00:46:52,873 --> 00:46:55,263
what we lost? I hope, yes.

557
00:46:55,288 --> 00:46:58,157
Keep what I found? I
have to, at all costs.

558
00:46:59,385 --> 00:47:03,231
And, maybe not die
trying will be nice.

559
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:07,523
Sounds like a deal.

560
00:47:30,586 --> 00:47:34,635
- Tony, I don't know...
- Why? He made it for you.

561
00:47:35,284 --> 00:47:39,693
Plus, honestly I have to get it out the
garage before Morgan takes it sledding.

562
00:47:44,428 --> 00:47:45,804
Thank you, Tony.

563
00:47:46,547 --> 00:47:50,697
Will you keep that a little quietly?
Didn't bring one for the whole team.

564
00:47:51,821 --> 00:47:57,301
- We are getting, the whole team, yeah?
- We're working on that right now.

565
00:48:15,411 --> 00:48:20,923
- Hey, humie! Where's big green?
- Kitchen. I think.

566
00:48:22,221 --> 00:48:26,489
- That's awesome.
- Rodent, careful on re-entry.

567
00:48:26,505 --> 00:48:29,108
There's an idiot on
the landing zone.

568
00:48:29,629 --> 00:48:30,630
Oh, God!

569
00:48:31,529 --> 00:48:34,014
What's up, regular-sized man?

570
00:49:24,390 --> 00:49:28,830
Kind of a step down from a golden palace
for an Avenger highness or whatnot.

571
00:49:28,855 --> 00:49:31,348
Hey, have a little compassion, pal.
First, they've lost Asgard,

572
00:49:31,373 --> 00:49:34,265
then half the people. They're probably
just happy they have a home.

573
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:36,409
You shouldn't have come!

574
00:49:37,902 --> 00:49:38,903
Valkyrie!

575
00:49:39,445 --> 00:49:41,782
Great to see you, Angry Girl.

576
00:49:42,079 --> 00:49:45,213
I think I liked you better
either of the other ways.

577
00:49:45,658 --> 00:49:47,839
- This is Rocket.
- How you doin'?

578
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:52,029
- He won't see you.
- That bad, huh?

579
00:49:52,430 --> 00:49:54,720
We only see him once a month,
when he comes in for...

580
00:49:55,971 --> 00:49:57,362
...supplies.

581
00:49:57,916 --> 00:49:59,918
- It's that bad.
- Yeah.

582
00:50:12,623 --> 00:50:13,749
What the...

583
00:50:16,300 --> 00:50:19,364
Woo! Something died in here.

584
00:50:20,005 --> 00:50:22,225
Hello? Thor?

585
00:50:22,694 --> 00:50:24,827
Are you here about the cable?

586
00:50:25,070 --> 00:50:30,660
The Cinemax ran out two weeks ago,
and, sports were all kind of fuzzy...

587
00:50:40,380 --> 00:50:43,162
Boys! Oh, my God!

588
00:50:44,703 --> 00:50:47,001
My God! How have you been?

589
00:50:47,204 --> 00:50:49,206
Come here, you little rascal!

590
00:50:49,690 --> 00:50:51,230
No, I'm good! I'm good.

591
00:50:51,605 --> 00:50:53,364
That's not necessary!

592
00:50:53,408 --> 00:50:56,222
Hulk, you know my friends,
Miek, Korg, right?

593
00:50:56,254 --> 00:50:58,619
- Hey, boys!
- Hey, guys. Long time no see.

594
00:50:58,644 --> 00:51:01,515
Beer's on the bucket. Feel
free to log on to the wi-fi.

595
00:51:01,540 --> 00:51:03,250
No password, obviously.

596
00:51:04,194 --> 00:51:08,258
Thor, he's back. That kid on the TV
who's called me a dickhead again.

597
00:51:09,095 --> 00:51:12,324
- Noobmaster.
- Yeah, Noobmaster69.

598
00:51:14,959 --> 00:51:17,961
Noobmaster. Hey, it's Thor again.
You know, the God of Thunder?

599
00:51:17,992 --> 00:51:21,033
Listen, buddy. If you don't log off
this game immediately I'm gonna fly

600
00:51:21,058 --> 00:51:23,879
home to your house, come down to
that basement you're hiding in,

601
00:51:23,904 --> 00:51:26,341
rip off your arms then
shove them up your butt!

602
00:51:26,758 --> 00:51:29,854
Oh, that's right. Yes, go cry to
your father, you little weasel!

603
00:51:30,158 --> 00:51:31,308
Thank you, Thor.

604
00:51:31,333 --> 00:51:32,920
Let me know if he
bothers you again, okay?

605
00:51:32,945 --> 00:51:34,442
Thank you very much. I will.

606
00:51:34,996 --> 00:51:36,669
So you guys want a drink?
What are you drinking?

607
00:51:36,694 --> 00:51:39,164
We have beer, tequila,
all sorts of things.

608
00:51:42,205 --> 00:51:44,762
Buddy, you all right?

609
00:51:44,809 --> 00:51:47,622
Yes, I'm fine! Why,
don't I look all right?

610
00:51:47,748 --> 00:51:49,796
You look like melted ice cream.

611
00:51:51,220 --> 00:51:53,667
So, what's up?

612
00:51:53,699 --> 00:51:58,146
We need your help. There might be
a chance we could fix everything.

613
00:51:58,202 --> 00:52:01,953
What, like the cable? 'Cause that's
been driving me bananas for weeks.

614
00:52:02,000 --> 00:52:03,392
Like Thanos.

615
00:52:22,115 --> 00:52:25,173
Don't say that name.

616
00:52:25,718 --> 00:52:28,783
Um, yeah. We don't actually
say that name in here.

617
00:52:33,603 --> 00:52:35,628
Please take your hand off me.

618
00:52:38,575 --> 00:52:39,576
Now, I know that...

619
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,936
guy might scare you.

620
00:52:44,195 --> 00:52:48,479
Why would I be? Why would, why
would I be scared of that guy?

621
00:52:49,066 --> 00:52:51,396
I'm the one who killed
that guy, remember?

622
00:52:52,138 --> 00:52:54,577
Anyone else here
killed that guy?

623
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,615
Nope. Didn't think so.

624
00:53:01,226 --> 00:53:05,353
Korg, why don't you, tell everybody
who chopped Thanos' big head off.

625
00:53:05,378 --> 00:53:07,144
Umm... Stormbreaker?

626
00:53:07,169 --> 00:53:09,692
Now, who's swinging
Stormbreaker?

627
00:53:12,866 --> 00:53:16,441
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay?
I've been there myself.

628
00:53:16,449 --> 00:53:18,692
You wanna know who
helped me out of it?

629
00:53:18,716 --> 00:53:21,670
I don't know. Is it... Natasha?

630
00:53:21,694 --> 00:53:22,859
It was you.

631
00:53:23,774 --> 00:53:25,423
You helped me.

632
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:31,747
Why don't you ask the,
Asgardians down there,

633
00:53:31,771 --> 00:53:34,304
how much my help was worth.

634
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:41,153
The ones that are left, anyway.

635
00:53:41,402 --> 00:53:43,186
I think we can bring them back.

636
00:53:43,678 --> 00:53:46,906
Stop. Just, stop...

637
00:53:47,832 --> 00:53:52,858
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in
my own self-pity, waiting to be rescued and

638
00:53:52,883 --> 00:53:55,699
and saved. But I'm fine, okay?
We're fine, aren't we?

639
00:53:55,724 --> 00:53:56,973
Nah, all good here, mate!

640
00:53:56,998 --> 00:53:58,857
So, whatever it is that
you're offering, we're

641
00:53:58,882 --> 00:54:01,234
not into it, don't care,
couldn't care less.

642
00:54:01,266 --> 00:54:02,390
Goodbye.

643
00:54:05,775 --> 00:54:07,050
We need you, pal.

644
00:54:16,838 --> 00:54:18,824
There's beer on the ship.

645
00:54:23,055 --> 00:54:24,189
What kind?

646
00:54:36,872 --> 00:54:39,224
It's him! He's after Akihiko!

647
00:55:10,097 --> 00:55:11,879
We never did anything to you!

648
00:55:24,315 --> 00:55:26,764
You're done hurting people.

649
00:55:32,912 --> 00:55:34,092
You're crazy!

650
00:56:01,334 --> 00:56:05,093
Wait! Help me!

651
00:56:10,777 --> 00:56:12,247
What I want...

652
00:56:12,969 --> 00:56:14,414
You can't give me.

653
00:56:37,941 --> 00:56:39,621
You shouldn't be here.

654
00:56:41,623 --> 00:56:43,179
Neither should you.

655
00:56:49,231 --> 00:56:50,880
I've got a job to do.

656
00:56:52,482 --> 00:56:54,561
Is that what you're
calling this?

657
00:56:55,172 --> 00:56:58,376
Killing all these people isn't
gonna bring your family back.

658
00:57:03,494 --> 00:57:05,088
We found something.

659
00:57:06,316 --> 00:57:08,419
A chance, maybe...

660
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:12,915
Don't.

661
00:57:14,080 --> 00:57:15,448
Don't what?

662
00:57:18,153 --> 00:57:19,951
Don't give me hope.

663
00:57:23,270 --> 00:57:25,936
I'm sorry I couldn't
give it to you sooner.

664
00:57:47,392 --> 00:57:51,019
Drifting left. On the
side there, Lebowski.

665
00:57:54,147 --> 00:57:56,338
- Ratchet, how's it going?
- It's Rocket.

666
00:57:56,363 --> 00:57:59,458
Take it easy. You're only
a genius on Earth, pal.

667
00:57:59,513 --> 00:58:00,513
Yup.

668
00:58:04,017 --> 00:58:06,533
Time travel suit? Not bad.

669
00:58:06,962 --> 00:58:08,604
Hey, hey, hey. Easy, easy!

670
00:58:08,635 --> 00:58:11,394
- I'm being very careful.
- No, you're being very Hulky.

671
00:58:11,403 --> 00:58:13,979
- I'm being careful.
- These are Pym particles, all right?

672
00:58:14,004 --> 00:58:16,757
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped
out of existence, this is it.

673
00:58:16,782 --> 00:58:18,837
This is what we have. We're
not making any more.

674
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:20,608
- Scott, calm down.
- Sorry.

675
00:58:20,647 --> 00:58:23,013
We've got enough for
one round trip, each.

676
00:58:23,038 --> 00:58:26,994
That's it. No do-overs.
Plus, two test runs.

677
00:58:31,550 --> 00:58:32,832
One test run.

678
00:58:33,629 --> 00:58:35,428
All right. I'm not
ready for this.

679
00:58:35,453 --> 00:58:36,537
I'm game.

680
00:58:39,094 --> 00:58:40,181
I'll do it.

681
00:58:41,220 --> 00:58:43,503
Clint, now you're gonna feel
a little discombobulated

682
00:58:43,528 --> 00:58:45,262
from the chronoshift.
Don't worry about it.

683
00:58:45,270 --> 00:58:46,597
Wait a second, let me
ask you something.

684
00:58:46,622 --> 00:58:49,444
If we can do this, you know, go
back in time, why don't we just

685
00:58:49,469 --> 00:58:52,657
find baby Thanos, you know?
And...

686
00:58:55,965 --> 00:58:58,208
- First of all, that's horrible.
- It's Thanos.

687
00:58:58,233 --> 00:59:02,775
And secondly, time doesn't work that way.
Changing the past doesn't change the future.

688
00:59:02,800 --> 00:59:05,669
Look, we go back, we get the
stones before Thanos gets them...

689
00:59:05,694 --> 00:59:08,594
Thanos doesn't have the stones.
Problem solved.

690
00:59:08,619 --> 00:59:10,477
- Bingo.
- That's not how it works.

691
00:59:10,502 --> 00:59:12,916
- Well, that's what I heard.
- What? By who? Who told you that?

692
00:59:12,949 --> 00:59:15,763
Star Trek, Terminator,
TimeCop, Time After Time,

693
00:59:15,788 --> 00:59:17,113
- Quantum Leap.
- A Wrinkle in Time,

694
00:59:17,138 --> 00:59:19,638
- Somewhere in Time,
- Hot Tub Time Machine.

695
00:59:19,663 --> 00:59:23,923
Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. Basically,
any movie that deals with time travel.

696
00:59:23,948 --> 00:59:25,793
Die Hard? No, it's not...

697
00:59:25,817 --> 00:59:26,857
This is known.

698
00:59:26,882 --> 00:59:29,226
I don't know why everyone believes
that, but that isn't true.

699
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,571
Think about it: If you travel to the
past, that past becomes your future.

700
00:59:33,721 --> 00:59:36,944
And your former present
becomes the past.

701
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:39,852
Which can't now be changed
by your new future...

702
00:59:39,896 --> 00:59:40,977
Exactly.

703
00:59:41,297 --> 00:59:43,954
So Back to the Future's
a bunch of bullshit?

704
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:54,877
All right, Clint. We're going in 3..
2.. 1...

705
01:01:07,343 --> 01:01:08,492
Cooper?

706
01:01:08,696 --> 01:01:11,534
- Where are my headphones?
- Lila?

707
01:01:16,841 --> 01:01:18,452
Lila! No!

708
01:01:23,691 --> 01:01:24,692
Dad?

709
01:01:28,600 --> 01:01:29,679
Dad?

710
01:01:40,190 --> 01:01:42,715
Hey, hey. Look at me. You okay?

711
01:01:43,567 --> 01:01:44,568
Yeah.

712
01:01:47,467 --> 01:01:48,766
It worked.

713
01:01:50,419 --> 01:01:51,584
It worked.

714
01:01:54,969 --> 01:01:56,891
Okay, so the "how" works.

715
01:01:57,400 --> 01:02:00,692
Now we gotta figure out the
"when," and the "where."

716
01:02:01,618 --> 01:02:03,353
Almost everyone in this
room has had an encounter

717
01:02:03,378 --> 01:02:05,206
with at least one of the
six Infinity Stones.

718
01:02:05,246 --> 01:02:07,011
Well, I'd subtitute the
word 'encounter' for 'damn

719
01:02:07,036 --> 01:02:09,498
near been killed by one of
the six Infinity Stones.'

720
01:02:09,694 --> 01:02:13,117
I haven't. I don't even know what
the hell you're all talking about.

721
01:02:13,242 --> 01:02:18,237
Regardless, we only have enough Pym
Particles for one round trip each,

722
01:02:18,284 --> 01:02:21,646
and these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

723
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:25,843
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.

724
01:02:26,032 --> 01:02:29,596
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.

725
01:02:29,690 --> 01:02:32,863
So. Let's start
with the Aether.

726
01:02:33,027 --> 01:02:34,965
Thor, what do you know?

727
01:02:39,946 --> 01:02:41,165
Is he asleep?

728
01:02:46,685 --> 01:02:49,022
Where to start? Umm...

729
01:02:50,165 --> 01:02:53,002
The Aether, first,
is not a stone.

730
01:02:53,182 --> 01:02:56,575
Someone's called it a stone before.
Ahem...

731
01:02:56,637 --> 01:03:00,342
It's more of a... an angry
sludge, sort of thing. So...

732
01:03:00,367 --> 01:03:03,510
Someone's gonna need to amend
that, and stop saying that.

733
01:03:03,717 --> 01:03:05,651
Here's an interesting
story, though.

734
01:03:05,732 --> 01:03:08,182
About the Aether. My
grandafther, many years

735
01:03:08,207 --> 01:03:12,212
ago, had to hide the stone
from the Dark Elves.

736
01:03:14,240 --> 01:03:16,022
Scary beings. So Jane...

737
01:03:17,367 --> 01:03:23,167
Oh, there she is. That's Jane...
She's... an old flame of mine.

738
01:03:23,767 --> 01:03:27,175
She... she stuck her hand
inside a rock this one time...

739
01:03:27,211 --> 01:03:30,537
and then the Aether stuck
itself inside her.

740
01:03:30,558 --> 01:03:33,763
And, she became very, very sick.
So I had to take her to

741
01:03:33,788 --> 01:03:37,524
Asgard, which is where I'm from.
And we had to try and fix her.

742
01:03:37,579 --> 01:03:43,200
We were dating at the time, you see. I
got to introduce her to my Mother...

743
01:03:44,617 --> 01:03:46,853
who's dead, and umm...

744
01:03:47,866 --> 01:03:51,666
Oh, you know. Jane and I aren't
even dating anymore, so...

745
01:03:52,001 --> 01:03:54,542
These things happen though, you know.
Nothing lasts forever.

746
01:03:54,567 --> 01:03:55,799
- The only thing that...
- Why don't you come sit down.

747
01:03:55,824 --> 01:04:00,226
I'm not done yet. The only thing that
is permanent in life, is impermanence.

748
01:04:00,985 --> 01:04:02,094
Awesome.

749
01:04:02,119 --> 01:04:03,290
Eggs? Breakfast?

750
01:04:03,315 --> 01:04:05,255
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary.

751
01:04:05,314 --> 01:04:08,169
Quill said he stole the
Power Stone from Morag.

752
01:04:08,412 --> 01:04:11,726
- Is that a person?
- Morag's a planet.

753
01:04:12,005 --> 01:04:13,701
Quill was a person.

754
01:04:14,303 --> 01:04:16,874
Like a planet? Like
in outer space?

755
01:04:17,000 --> 01:04:20,807
Oh, look. It's like a little
puppy, all happy and everything.

756
01:04:20,939 --> 01:04:24,465
Do you wanna go to space? You
wanna go to space, puppy?

757
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:26,714
I'll take you to space.

758
01:04:27,004 --> 01:04:30,639
- Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir.
- What is Vormir?

759
01:04:31,210 --> 01:04:35,705
A dominion of death, at the very
center of Celestial existence.

760
01:04:37,099 --> 01:04:40,891
It's where... Thanos
murdered my sister.

761
01:04:47,307 --> 01:04:48,307
Noted.

762
01:04:50,168 --> 01:04:52,270
- That Time Stone guy...
- Doctor Strange.

763
01:04:52,310 --> 01:04:53,857
Yeah, what kind
of doctor was he?

764
01:04:53,865 --> 01:04:57,524
- Neurostuff meets rabbit from a hat.
- Nice place in the village, though.

765
01:04:57,556 --> 01:05:00,008
- Yeah. Sullivan Street.
- Hmm... Bleecker.

766
01:05:00,033 --> 01:05:01,643
Wait, he lived in New York?

767
01:05:01,909 --> 01:05:04,887
- No. He lived in Toronto.
- Yeah, not Bleecker. It's Sullivan.

768
01:05:05,259 --> 01:05:10,144
Guys, if you pick the right year,
there are three stones in New York.

769
01:05:12,428 --> 01:05:13,866
Shut the front door!

770
01:05:16,813 --> 01:05:19,353
All right. We have a plan.

771
01:05:19,431 --> 01:05:24,066
Six stones, three
teams, one shot.

772
01:05:33,399 --> 01:05:35,502
Five years ago, we lost.

773
01:05:36,511 --> 01:05:37,690
All of us.

774
01:05:39,779 --> 01:05:40,827
We lost friends...

775
01:05:42,224 --> 01:05:43,319
We lost family...

776
01:05:45,701 --> 01:05:47,514
We lost a part of ourselves.

777
01:05:48,742 --> 01:05:51,204
Today, we have a chance
to take it all back.

778
01:05:52,422 --> 01:05:55,603
You know your teams, you
know your missions.

779
01:05:56,018 --> 01:05:58,848
Get the stones, get them back.

780
01:05:58,903 --> 01:06:03,265
One round trip each. No mistakes.
No do-overs.

781
01:06:03,688 --> 01:06:05,905
Most of us are going
somewhere we know.

782
01:06:05,959 --> 01:06:08,648
But it doesn't mean we
should know what to expect.

783
01:06:08,867 --> 01:06:12,072
Be careful. Look out
for each other.

784
01:06:13,152 --> 01:06:17,303
This is the fight of our lives.
And we're gonna win.

785
01:06:19,576 --> 01:06:21,032
Whatever it takes.

786
01:06:23,729 --> 01:06:25,027
Good luck.

787
01:06:25,706 --> 01:06:27,498
- He's pretty good at that.
- Right?

788
01:06:27,576 --> 01:06:30,515
All right. You heard the man.
Stroke those keys, jelly green.

789
01:06:31,225 --> 01:06:33,336
Tractors engaged.

790
01:06:33,713 --> 01:06:35,751
You promise to bring that
back in one piece, right?

791
01:06:35,776 --> 01:06:37,769
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
yeah. Okay.

792
01:06:37,794 --> 01:06:41,554
- I'll do my best.
- As promises go, that was pretty lame.

793
01:06:44,113 --> 01:06:45,596
See you in a minute.

794
01:07:39,749 --> 01:07:43,165
All right, we all have our assignments.
Two stones uptown, one stone, down.

795
01:07:43,587 --> 01:07:45,971
Stay low. Keep an
eye on the clock.

796
01:08:00,813 --> 01:08:03,149
Feel free to smash if
things don't go your way.

797
01:08:03,940 --> 01:08:06,120
I think it's gratuitous,
but whatever.

798
01:08:33,571 --> 01:08:37,026
I'd be careful going that way.
We just had the floors waxed.

799
01:08:41,544 --> 01:08:44,186
Ma'am, I'm looking
for Doctor Strange.

800
01:08:45,476 --> 01:08:48,400
You're about... five
years too early.

801
01:08:48,790 --> 01:08:53,129
Stephen Strange is currently performing
surgery about twenty blocks that way.

802
01:08:54,431 --> 01:08:56,201
What do you want from him?

803
01:08:56,572 --> 01:08:58,104
That, actually.

804
01:08:58,393 --> 01:08:59,394
Ah.

805
01:09:00,732 --> 01:09:03,905
- I'm afraid not.
- Sorry, but I wasn't asking.

806
01:09:04,429 --> 01:09:06,359
- You don't wanna do this.
- You're right. I don't.

807
01:09:06,384 --> 01:09:09,620
But I need that stone, and
I don't have time to...

808
01:09:17,647 --> 01:09:19,625
Let's start over, shall we?

809
01:09:38,937 --> 01:09:40,094
That's Jane.

810
01:09:41,736 --> 01:09:42,815
All right.

811
01:09:44,416 --> 01:09:45,995
Here's the deal, Tubby:

812
01:09:46,004 --> 01:09:48,095
You're gonna charm her and I'm
gonna poke her with this thing

813
01:09:48,120 --> 01:09:51,351
and extract the Reality Stone
and get gone, lickety-split.

814
01:09:52,399 --> 01:09:55,706
I'll be right back, okay? There's a
wine cellar, that's just down there.

815
01:09:55,731 --> 01:09:58,528
My father used to fish
with a barrel of ale.

816
01:09:58,584 --> 01:10:02,789
- I'll see if the cellar has a couple of...
- Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already?

817
01:10:21,605 --> 01:10:23,496
Who's the fancy broad?

818
01:10:24,358 --> 01:10:28,024
It's my Mother.
She dies today.

819
01:10:29,110 --> 01:10:30,978
Oh. That's today?

820
01:10:37,118 --> 01:10:40,182
I can't do this.
I can't do this.

821
01:10:40,207 --> 01:10:43,544
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come.
This was a bad idea.

822
01:10:43,654 --> 01:10:45,889
- Come here.
- No, no, no. I think I'm having...

823
01:10:45,928 --> 01:10:49,375
- I'm having a panic attack.
- Come here. Right here.

824
01:10:49,908 --> 01:10:53,792
You think you're the only one who lost
people? What do you think we're doing here?

825
01:10:53,817 --> 01:10:55,989
I lost the only
family I ever had.

826
01:10:56,014 --> 01:11:00,196
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick
with the antenna, all gone.

827
01:11:00,798 --> 01:11:05,246
Now, I get you miss your Mom.
But she's gone. Really gone.

828
01:11:05,559 --> 01:11:08,389
And there are plenty of people
who are only kinda gone.

829
01:11:08,428 --> 01:11:10,242
But you can help them.

830
01:11:10,671 --> 01:11:14,052
So is it too much to ask that you
brush the crumbs outta your beard,

831
01:11:14,077 --> 01:11:18,033
make schmoopy talk to Pretty
Pants, and when she's not looking,

832
01:11:18,260 --> 01:11:22,168
suck out the Infinity Stone and
help me get my family back?

833
01:11:23,104 --> 01:11:24,105
Okay.

834
01:11:24,573 --> 01:11:27,294
- Are you crying?
- No...

835
01:11:29,440 --> 01:11:30,441
Yes!

836
01:11:30,581 --> 01:11:33,130
Get it together!
You can do this.

837
01:11:33,724 --> 01:11:35,381
You can do this.

838
01:11:38,454 --> 01:11:39,634
All right?

839
01:11:39,963 --> 01:11:42,152
- Yes, I can.
- Good.

840
01:11:43,958 --> 01:11:46,380
I can do this.

841
01:11:47,381 --> 01:11:48,624
I can't do this.

842
01:11:48,804 --> 01:11:52,391
Alright, Heartbreaker. She's alone.
This is our shot.

843
01:11:52,447 --> 01:11:53,447
Thor?

844
01:11:54,081 --> 01:11:55,081
Thor!

845
01:12:05,390 --> 01:12:07,047
Alright. Bring it down low.

846
01:12:07,072 --> 01:12:09,617
Right on that line. That's it.
Down, down.

847
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:15,467
Hey, can we hurry it up?

848
01:12:15,492 --> 01:12:17,699
Guys, chop-chop. Come on.
We're on the clock.

849
01:12:17,844 --> 01:12:20,708
All that, is really helpful.

850
01:12:21,973 --> 01:12:23,668
- Take care, okay?
- Yeah.

851
01:12:23,788 --> 01:12:26,288
Take that stone and come back.
No messing around.

852
01:12:26,537 --> 01:12:28,350
- Hey.
- You got this.

853
01:12:28,448 --> 01:12:29,697
- Let's get it done.
- Yes, sir.

854
01:12:29,757 --> 01:12:31,370
See you back.

855
01:12:31,886 --> 01:12:33,810
You guys watch each other's six.

856
01:12:33,818 --> 01:12:34,819
Yeah.

857
01:12:43,739 --> 01:12:46,154
The coordinates for
Vormir are laid in.

858
01:12:46,942 --> 01:12:49,451
All they have to do
is not fall out.

859
01:12:54,858 --> 01:12:57,492
We're a long way from Budapest.

860
01:13:01,782 --> 01:13:03,165
Okay, so, uhh...

861
01:13:04,852 --> 01:13:07,798
We just wait around for this
Quill guy to show up and

862
01:13:07,823 --> 01:13:10,497
then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?

863
01:13:10,958 --> 01:13:12,584
Let's take cover.

864
01:13:13,538 --> 01:13:16,571
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

865
01:13:16,696 --> 01:13:18,111
Wait a minute, what are
you talking about right

866
01:13:18,136 --> 01:13:20,080
now? Who else is looking
for these stones?

867
01:13:23,149 --> 01:13:25,683
My father, my sister...

868
01:13:26,663 --> 01:13:29,149
- and me.
- And you?

869
01:13:30,828 --> 01:13:32,789
Where are you right now?

870
01:14:01,369 --> 01:14:04,637
- You're welcome.
- I didn't ask for your help.

871
01:14:05,363 --> 01:14:07,974
And yet, you always need it.

872
01:14:11,079 --> 01:14:12,197
Get up.

873
01:14:12,283 --> 01:14:14,643
- Father wants us back on the ship.
- Why?

874
01:14:14,698 --> 01:14:17,184
He's found an Infinity Stone.

875
01:14:20,891 --> 01:14:24,627
- Where?
- On a planet called Morag.

876
01:14:25,991 --> 01:14:28,282
Father's plan is
finally in motion.

877
01:14:28,307 --> 01:14:31,668
- One stone isn't six, Nebula.
- It's a start.

878
01:14:31,829 --> 01:14:34,338
If he gets all of them...

879
01:14:46,287 --> 01:14:50,008
Ronan's located the Power Stone.
I'm dispatching you to his ship.

880
01:14:50,033 --> 01:14:53,393
- He won't like that.
- His alternative is death, then.

881
01:14:55,099 --> 01:14:59,993
Ronan's obsession
clouds his judgement.

882
01:15:04,269 --> 01:15:06,341
We will not fail you, Father.

883
01:15:07,444 --> 01:15:09,273
No, you won't.

884
01:15:11,808 --> 01:15:13,136
I swear...

885
01:15:14,631 --> 01:15:16,811
I will make you proud.

886
01:15:24,930 --> 01:15:28,117
We just, wait around for
this Quill guy to show up,

887
01:15:28,142 --> 01:15:30,738
and then he leads us to the
Power Stone, is that it?

888
01:15:31,122 --> 01:15:32,599
Let's take cover.

889
01:15:33,498 --> 01:15:37,039
We're not the only ones in
2014 looking for the stones.

890
01:15:38,916 --> 01:15:41,112
- Who was that?
- I don't know...

891
01:15:41,174 --> 01:15:44,254
My head is splitting...
I don't know...

892
01:15:45,442 --> 01:15:48,777
Her synaptic drive was
probably damaged in battle.

893
01:15:58,513 --> 01:16:00,412
Bring her to my ship.

894
01:16:08,397 --> 01:16:10,954
Got to hustle, Cap. Things look like
they're just about wrapped up here.

895
01:16:10,979 --> 01:16:13,566
Got it. I'm approaching
the elevator now.

896
01:16:19,489 --> 01:16:21,490
If it's all the same to you...

897
01:16:23,631 --> 01:16:25,300
I'll have that drink now.

898
01:16:25,571 --> 01:16:29,995
All right. Good one. No standing around,
I'm closing up this door for later.

899
01:16:30,034 --> 01:16:31,980
By the way, feel
free to clean up.

900
01:16:32,027 --> 01:16:34,638
Ugh, Mr. Rogers. I almost
forgot that that suit

901
01:16:34,684 --> 01:16:38,124
- did nothing for your ass.
- No one asked you to look.

902
01:16:38,183 --> 01:16:40,192
I think you look great, Cap.

903
01:16:40,217 --> 01:16:43,910
As far as I'm concerned,
that's America's ass.

904
01:16:44,023 --> 01:16:47,131
- Uhh, magic wand?
- STRIKE team's coming to secure it.

905
01:16:57,281 --> 01:16:59,195
We can take that
off your hands.

906
01:16:59,297 --> 01:17:00,524
By all means.

907
01:17:02,347 --> 01:17:05,943
- Careful with that thing!
- Unless you want your mind erased.

908
01:17:05,968 --> 01:17:08,140
- Not in a fun way.
- We promise to be careful.

909
01:17:08,175 --> 01:17:10,997
- Who are these guys?
- They are SHIELD...

910
01:17:11,036 --> 01:17:13,897
Well, actually Hydra. But,
we didn't know that yet.

911
01:17:13,947 --> 01:17:17,934
Seriously, you didn't? I mean...
they look like bad guys.

912
01:17:17,981 --> 01:17:19,835
You're small, but
you're talking loud.

913
01:17:19,860 --> 01:17:21,474
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue.

914
01:17:21,499 --> 01:17:23,627
On my way down to
coordinate search and rescue!

915
01:17:23,652 --> 01:17:26,423
I mean, honestly! How do
you think you'll be...

916
01:17:26,448 --> 01:17:27,669
Shut up.

917
01:17:29,100 --> 01:17:32,008
All right, you're up, little buddy.
There's our stone.

918
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,674
Alright. Flick me.

919
01:17:49,821 --> 01:17:51,420
- Whoa! Whoa, whoa.
- Hey! Buddy.

920
01:17:51,455 --> 01:17:53,854
What do you think? Maximum
occupancy has been reached.

921
01:17:53,879 --> 01:17:56,716
- Take the stairs!
- Yeah. Stop. Stop!

922
01:17:59,510 --> 01:18:02,622
Take the stairs.
Take the stairs!

923
01:18:05,960 --> 01:18:10,728
All right, Cap. I got our scepter in the
elevator just passing the 80th floor.

924
01:18:11,330 --> 01:18:12,347
On it.

925
01:18:13,034 --> 01:18:15,520
- Head to the lobby.
- Alright. I'll see you there.

926
01:18:15,545 --> 01:18:18,522
Evidence secure. We're
en route to Dr. List.

927
01:18:19,086 --> 01:18:22,455
No. No hitches at all, Mr.
Secretary.

928
01:18:27,622 --> 01:18:30,601
Captain. I thought you were
coordinating search and rescue?

929
01:18:30,687 --> 01:18:32,336
Change of plans.

930
01:18:35,853 --> 01:18:36,940
Hey, Cap.

931
01:18:38,289 --> 01:18:39,528
Rumlow.

932
01:18:46,068 --> 01:18:50,101
I just got a call from the Secretary. I'm
gonna be running point on the scepter.

933
01:18:52,274 --> 01:18:55,025
Sir? I don't understand.

934
01:18:56,973 --> 01:18:59,091
We got word there may be
an attempt to steal it.

935
01:18:59,116 --> 01:19:00,366
Sorry, Cap.

936
01:19:00,795 --> 01:19:02,685
I can't give you the scepter.

937
01:19:02,819 --> 01:19:07,157
- I'm gonna have to call the Director.
- That's okay. Trust me.

938
01:19:10,674 --> 01:19:12,221
Hail Hydra.

939
01:19:26,212 --> 01:19:28,308
So many stairs!

940
01:19:39,813 --> 01:19:42,596
Thumbelina, do you copy?
I've got eyes on the prize.

941
01:19:42,620 --> 01:19:45,114
- It is go-time.
- Bombs away.

942
01:19:52,445 --> 01:19:54,563
Is, is that Axe body spray?

943
01:19:54,588 --> 01:19:57,363
Yeah, I had a can just
for emergencies. Relax.

944
01:19:57,433 --> 01:20:01,506
- Can we focus, please?
- I'm going inside you. Now.

945
01:20:06,859 --> 01:20:08,606
May I ask you
where you're going?

946
01:20:08,631 --> 01:20:11,137
To lunch and then Asgard.
I'm sorry, you are?

947
01:20:11,162 --> 01:20:14,798
Alexander Pierce. He's the man, one
of the folks behind Nick Fury.

948
01:20:14,823 --> 01:20:16,290
My friends call me Mr. Secretary.

949
01:20:16,324 --> 01:20:18,793
I'm gonna have to ask you to
turn that prisoner over to me.

950
01:20:18,864 --> 01:20:21,920
- Loki will be answering to Odin himself.
- Oh, he's gonna answer to us.

951
01:20:21,946 --> 01:20:24,672
Odin can have what's left. And
I'm gonna need that case.

952
01:20:24,829 --> 01:20:26,831
That's been SHIELD property
for over 70 years.

953
01:20:26,856 --> 01:20:28,074
Hand over the case, Stark.

954
01:20:28,099 --> 01:20:30,741
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things
are getting dicey up here. Let's go.

955
01:20:30,766 --> 01:20:32,935
I'm not gonna argue who's got the
higher authority here, all right?

956
01:20:32,960 --> 01:20:34,352
You promise me you won't die?

957
01:20:34,377 --> 01:20:37,360
You're only giving me a
mild cardiac dysrythmia.

958
01:20:37,415 --> 01:20:39,119
That doesn't sound mild.

959
01:20:39,144 --> 01:20:39,763
I need the case.

960
01:20:39,788 --> 01:20:41,623
I know you got a lotta pull.
I'm just saying...

961
01:20:41,648 --> 01:20:43,438
Okay. Then give me the case.

962
01:20:45,361 --> 01:20:46,362
Do it, Lang!

963
01:20:46,385 --> 01:20:49,114
- Get your hands off!
- Window's closing. Pull my pin!

964
01:20:49,277 --> 01:20:50,396
Here goes!

965
01:20:53,656 --> 01:20:55,532
- Stark?
- Stark!

966
01:20:55,571 --> 01:20:57,579
Look, he's convulsing.
Give him air!

967
01:20:57,604 --> 01:20:59,613
- Medic!
- Medic!

968
01:20:59,871 --> 01:21:01,856
You got some help!

969
01:21:03,100 --> 01:21:05,687
Stark, you... your
chest machine?

970
01:21:07,469 --> 01:21:08,720
Breathe! Breathe!

971
01:21:14,007 --> 01:21:16,954
Good job. Meet me in the alley.
I'm gonna grab a quick slice.

972
01:21:22,395 --> 01:21:24,490
No stairs!

973
01:21:32,047 --> 01:21:33,557
You'll be fine, Stark.
Stay with us!

974
01:21:33,588 --> 01:21:36,621
I'll try something, okay? I have
no idea if it's gonna work.

975
01:21:38,184 --> 01:21:38,857
Yes!

976
01:21:38,882 --> 01:21:41,140
That worked a treat.
That was so crazy!

977
01:21:41,156 --> 01:21:43,173
I had no idea if
that was gonna work.

978
01:21:43,198 --> 01:21:45,040
- The case...
- The case. It's, uhh...

979
01:21:45,081 --> 01:21:47,551
Where's the case? Where's Loki?

980
01:21:47,824 --> 01:21:48,824
Loki!

981
01:21:48,857 --> 01:21:51,968
- That wasn't supposed to happen, was it?
- Oh, we blew it.

982
01:21:52,015 --> 01:21:53,422
Loki!?

983
01:21:55,501 --> 01:21:57,197
Tony, what's going on?

984
01:21:57,682 --> 01:21:59,832
Tell me you found that cube.

985
01:22:01,732 --> 01:22:03,795
Oh, you gotta be shitting me.

986
01:22:07,642 --> 01:22:10,043
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor.

987
01:22:10,153 --> 01:22:11,466
I'm not Loki.

988
01:22:14,837 --> 01:22:16,822
And I don't wanna hurt you.

989
01:22:25,656 --> 01:22:26,938
I can do this all day.

990
01:22:26,963 --> 01:22:29,347
Yeah, I know. I know.

991
01:23:01,873 --> 01:23:03,733
Where did you get this?

992
01:23:14,268 --> 01:23:17,836
Bucky... is... alive!

993
01:23:20,681 --> 01:23:21,681
What?

994
01:23:36,687 --> 01:23:38,782
That is America's ass.

995
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:45,716
- Please, please!
- I'm sorry. I can't help you, Bruce.

996
01:23:46,616 --> 01:23:50,243
If I give up the Time Stone to help
your reality, I'm dooming my own.

997
01:23:50,291 --> 01:23:55,145
With all due respect, I'm not sure
the science really supports that.

998
01:24:00,770 --> 01:24:04,912
The Infinity Stones create what you
experience as the flow of time.

999
01:24:05,151 --> 01:24:08,873
Remove one of the stones,
and that flow splits.

1000
01:24:09,131 --> 01:24:14,197
Now this may benefit your reality.
But my new one, not so much.

1001
01:24:14,237 --> 01:24:19,482
In this new branched reality, without our
chief weapon against the forces of darkness,

1002
01:24:19,705 --> 01:24:23,583
our world will be overrun.
Millions will suffer.

1003
01:24:23,700 --> 01:24:27,796
So, tell me, doctor, can your
science prevent all that?

1004
01:24:27,898 --> 01:24:31,196
No. But we can erase it.

1005
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:35,128
Because once we're done with the stones, we
can return each one into its own timeline

1006
01:24:35,153 --> 01:24:39,514
at the moment it was taken.
So, chronologically...

1007
01:24:40,531 --> 01:24:45,714
In that reality...
it never left.

1008
01:24:48,101 --> 01:24:51,267
Yes, but you're leaving out
the most important part.

1009
01:24:54,715 --> 01:24:57,551
In order to return the
stones, you have to survive.

1010
01:24:57,598 --> 01:25:00,413
We will. I will. I promise.

1011
01:25:01,071 --> 01:25:03,824
I can't risk this
reality on a promise.

1012
01:25:04,160 --> 01:25:08,944
It's the duty, of the Sorcerer
Supreme to protect the Time Stone.

1013
01:25:09,680 --> 01:25:12,540
Then why the hell did
Strange give it away?

1014
01:25:13,338 --> 01:25:15,557
- What did you say?
- Strange. He gave it away.

1015
01:25:15,596 --> 01:25:17,380
He gave it to Thanos.

1016
01:25:17,660 --> 01:25:19,552
- Willingly?
- Yes.

1017
01:25:23,308 --> 01:25:26,482
- Why?
- I have no idea. Maybe he made a mistake.

1018
01:25:36,942 --> 01:25:38,224
Or I did.

1019
01:25:58,364 --> 01:26:01,053
Strange was meant to
be the best of us.

1020
01:26:01,077 --> 01:26:03,946
So he must've done
it for a reason.

1021
01:26:04,343 --> 01:26:06,688
I fear you might be right.

1022
01:26:10,800 --> 01:26:12,035
Thank you.

1023
01:26:18,209 --> 01:26:20,125
I'm counting on you, Bruce.

1024
01:26:22,064 --> 01:26:23,423
We all are.

1025
01:26:43,575 --> 01:26:45,147
Run diagnostics.

1026
01:26:45,976 --> 01:26:47,813
Show me her memory file.

1027
01:26:49,548 --> 01:26:52,073
Sire, the file appears entangled.

1028
01:26:53,223 --> 01:26:55,505
It was a memory, but not hers.

1029
01:26:56,326 --> 01:26:59,437
There's another consciousness
sharing her network.

1030
01:26:59,773 --> 01:27:01,188
Another Nebula.

1031
01:27:03,330 --> 01:27:04,620
Impossible.

1032
01:27:05,074 --> 01:27:10,483
This duplicate carries a time stamp...
from nine years in the future.

1033
01:27:15,255 --> 01:27:17,311
Where is this other Nebula?

1034
01:27:18,210 --> 01:27:20,977
In our solar system.
On Morag.

1035
01:27:21,893 --> 01:27:25,434
- Can you access her?
- Yes. The two are linked.

1036
01:27:25,465 --> 01:27:29,882
Search the duplicate's
memories, for Infinity Stones.

1037
01:27:33,530 --> 01:27:36,681
And these stones have been in a lot of
different places throughout history.

1038
01:27:36,697 --> 01:27:40,706
Our history. So, not a lot of
convenient spots to just drop in.

1039
01:27:40,730 --> 01:27:43,544
- Which means we have to pick our targets.
- Correct.

1040
01:27:43,569 --> 01:27:44,905
Freeze image.

1041
01:27:46,594 --> 01:27:47,923
Terrans.

1042
01:27:48,681 --> 01:27:50,386
Avengers.

1043
01:27:51,473 --> 01:27:55,639
Unruly wretches. What's
that reflection?

1044
01:27:56,468 --> 01:27:59,025
Amplify this, Maw.

1045
01:28:01,018 --> 01:28:02,675
I don't understand.

1046
01:28:07,084 --> 01:28:11,571
- Two Nebulas.
- No. The same Nebula.

1047
01:28:12,015 --> 01:28:13,899
From two different times.

1048
01:28:14,923 --> 01:28:19,058
Set course for Morag. Scan
the duplicate's memories.

1049
01:28:19,958 --> 01:28:22,498
I want to see everything.

1050
01:28:32,218 --> 01:28:34,205
My ladies, I'll see you after.
Go on.

1051
01:28:50,056 --> 01:28:52,572
- What are you doing?
- Ahh!

1052
01:28:53,987 --> 01:28:56,630
You're better off leaving the
sneaking to your brother.

1053
01:28:56,662 --> 01:28:58,897
Yeah, I was simply just
going for a walk, and uh...

1054
01:28:58,922 --> 01:29:00,321
What are you wearing?

1055
01:29:00,346 --> 01:29:02,689
I always wear this. This
is one of my favorites.

1056
01:29:06,759 --> 01:29:08,220
What's wrong with your eye?

1057
01:29:08,245 --> 01:29:11,395
Oh, my eye. That's... you
remember the Battle of Haroquin?

1058
01:29:11,411 --> 01:29:14,600
When I got hit in the
face with a broadsword?

1059
01:29:18,202 --> 01:29:21,250
You're not the Thor I
know at all, are you?

1060
01:29:21,259 --> 01:29:22,979
Yes, I am.

1061
01:29:23,207 --> 01:29:26,013
The future hasn't been
kind to you, has it?

1062
01:29:26,177 --> 01:29:28,511
I didn't say I'm
from the future.

1063
01:29:28,590 --> 01:29:31,022
I was raised by witches, boy.

1064
01:29:31,929 --> 01:29:35,110
I see with more than
eyes, and you know that.

1065
01:29:36,571 --> 01:29:39,157
I am totally, totally
from the future!

1066
01:29:39,183 --> 01:29:40,224
Yes, you are.

1067
01:29:40,886 --> 01:29:43,692
- I really need to talk to you.
- We can talk.

1068
01:30:07,845 --> 01:30:09,627
His head was over there...

1069
01:30:10,339 --> 01:30:12,004
His body over there...

1070
01:30:13,858 --> 01:30:16,099
What was the point.
I was too late.

1071
01:30:17,155 --> 01:30:18,733
I was just standing there.

1072
01:30:20,055 --> 01:30:23,010
- Some idiot with an ax.
- You're no idiot.

1073
01:30:24,473 --> 01:30:28,983
You're here aren't you? Seeking counsel
from the wisest person in Asgard.

1074
01:30:29,280 --> 01:30:31,845
- I guess, yeah.
- Idiot? No.

1075
01:30:31,962 --> 01:30:36,143
- A failure? Absolutely.
- That's a little bit harsh.

1076
01:30:36,198 --> 01:30:38,895
You do know what
that makes you?

1077
01:30:39,046 --> 01:30:41,359
Just like everyone else.

1078
01:30:41,500 --> 01:30:44,541
I'm not supposed to be
like everyone else, am I?

1079
01:30:44,900 --> 01:30:48,214
Everyone fails at who they
are supposed to be, Thor.

1080
01:30:48,891 --> 01:30:51,998
The measure of a
person, of a hero

1081
01:30:52,082 --> 01:30:55,443
is how well they succeed
at being who they are.

1082
01:31:00,625 --> 01:31:02,446
I really missed you, Mum.

1083
01:31:08,105 --> 01:31:10,066
Thor! I got it!

1084
01:31:10,620 --> 01:31:12,395
Get that rabbit!

1085
01:31:15,155 --> 01:31:18,556
- Ma, I have to tell you something.
- No, son. You don't.

1086
01:31:18,956 --> 01:31:21,785
You're here to repair
your future, not mine.

1087
01:31:21,817 --> 01:31:25,584
- But this is about your future.
- It's none of my business.

1088
01:31:28,908 --> 01:31:29,908
Hey.

1089
01:31:30,063 --> 01:31:31,595
You must be Mom.

1090
01:31:32,401 --> 01:31:34,346
I got the thing. Come
on, we got to move.

1091
01:31:34,371 --> 01:31:37,866
- I wish we had more time.
- This was a gift.

1092
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,647
And you're going to be the
man you're meant to be.

1093
01:31:41,695 --> 01:31:44,642
- I love you, Mom.
- I love you.

1094
01:31:47,886 --> 01:31:49,418
And eat a salad.

1095
01:31:50,990 --> 01:31:52,835
- Come on. We gotta go.
- Goodbye.

1096
01:31:52,851 --> 01:31:55,633
- Three... two...
- No, wait!

1097
01:31:58,651 --> 01:31:59,784
Wh-what am I looking at?

1098
01:31:59,809 --> 01:32:02,130
Oh, sometimes it takes a second.

1099
01:32:11,137 --> 01:32:12,638
I'm still worthy.

1100
01:32:14,030 --> 01:32:15,304
Oh, boy.

1101
01:32:16,883 --> 01:32:18,868
Goodbye, Mom.

1102
01:32:58,037 --> 01:32:59,530
So he's an idiot?

1103
01:33:10,928 --> 01:33:12,115
What's that?

1104
01:33:12,156 --> 01:33:13,773
The tool of a thief.

1105
01:33:21,872 --> 01:33:23,406
Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa...

1106
01:33:23,876 --> 01:33:27,583
This is the part where spikes come out,
with skeletons on the end and everything...

1107
01:33:27,608 --> 01:33:28,521
What are you talking about?

1108
01:33:28,546 --> 01:33:31,174
When you break into a place called
the temple of the Power Stone,

1109
01:33:31,199 --> 01:33:35,014
There's gonna be a bunch of booby
traps... Okay. All right. Go ahead.

1110
01:34:08,183 --> 01:34:09,957
I wasn't always like this.

1111
01:34:10,861 --> 01:34:12,067
Me either.

1112
01:34:13,393 --> 01:34:15,602
But we work with
what we got, right?

1113
01:34:18,830 --> 01:34:19,933
Sync up.

1114
01:34:22,137 --> 01:34:24,553
Three.. two.. one...

1115
01:34:37,486 --> 01:34:38,963
You murdered trillions!

1116
01:34:38,988 --> 01:34:40,725
You should be grateful.

1117
01:34:42,390 --> 01:34:45,400
- Where are the stones?
- Gone.

1118
01:34:45,790 --> 01:34:49,472
- Reduced to atoms.
- You used them two days ago.

1119
01:34:49,563 --> 01:34:54,557
I used the stones to destroy the stones.
It nearly killed me.

1120
01:34:54,714 --> 01:34:58,779
But the work is done.
It always will be.

1121
01:34:59,959 --> 01:35:03,743
I am inevitable.

1122
01:35:04,721 --> 01:35:10,592
- What did you do to them?
- Nothing. Yet.

1123
01:35:11,840 --> 01:35:15,725
They're not trying to stop something
I'm going to do in our time.

1124
01:35:16,200 --> 01:35:19,742
They're trying to undo something
I've already done in theirs.

1125
01:35:19,992 --> 01:35:21,547
The stones...

1126
01:35:22,492 --> 01:35:24,291
I found them all.

1127
01:35:25,978 --> 01:35:27,229
I won.

1128
01:35:28,292 --> 01:35:31,266
Tipped the cosmic
scales to balance.

1129
01:35:35,425 --> 01:35:36,832
This is your future.

1130
01:35:37,395 --> 01:35:38,880
It's my destiny.

1131
01:35:40,624 --> 01:35:44,602
My father is many things. A
liar is not one of them.

1132
01:35:48,287 --> 01:35:49,633
Thank you, Daughter.

1133
01:35:49,992 --> 01:35:53,088
Perhaps I treated
you too harshly...

1134
01:35:57,094 --> 01:35:59,861
And that, is destiny fulfilled.

1135
01:36:00,573 --> 01:36:03,864
Sire, your Daughter...

1136
01:36:05,473 --> 01:36:06,474
No...

1137
01:36:06,927 --> 01:36:08,216
...is a traitor.

1138
01:36:08,241 --> 01:36:12,900
That's not me. It's not. I could never...
I would never betray you. Never.

1139
01:36:19,958 --> 01:36:21,169
I know.

1140
01:36:21,996 --> 01:36:24,717
And you'll have the
chance to prove it.

1141
01:36:31,609 --> 01:36:32,609
No...

1142
01:36:33,172 --> 01:36:34,501
He knows!

1143
01:36:38,784 --> 01:36:41,543
Barton? Barton, come in.

1144
01:36:41,606 --> 01:36:45,835
Romanoff? Come in, we have a problem.
Come on!

1145
01:36:46,235 --> 01:36:47,618
Come in, we have a prob...

1146
01:36:47,845 --> 01:36:49,698
Thanos knows.

1147
01:36:49,808 --> 01:36:51,114
Thanos...

1148
01:37:05,165 --> 01:37:06,166
Cap...

1149
01:37:07,753 --> 01:37:09,820
Sorry, buddy.
We got a problem.

1150
01:37:09,863 --> 01:37:12,357
Huh. Yeah, we do.

1151
01:37:12,623 --> 01:37:14,905
- Well, what are we gonna do now?
- You know what, give me a break, Steve.

1152
01:37:14,931 --> 01:37:16,619
I just got hit in the
head with a Hulk.

1153
01:37:16,753 --> 01:37:19,699
You said that we had one shot.
This, this was our shot.

1154
01:37:19,724 --> 01:37:22,392
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing.
Six stones or nothing.

1155
01:37:22,418 --> 01:37:24,504
You're repeating yourself, you know that?
You're repeating yourself.

1156
01:37:24,529 --> 01:37:26,310
You're repeating yourself.
You're repeating yourself.

1157
01:37:26,335 --> 01:37:27,219
- No!
- Come on.

1158
01:37:27,244 --> 01:37:29,541
You never wanted a time heist, you
went on board with the time heist...

1159
01:37:29,566 --> 01:37:30,933
- I dropped the ball.
- You ruined the time heist.

1160
01:37:30,958 --> 01:37:32,175
- Is that what I did?
- Yeah!

1161
01:37:32,200 --> 01:37:34,113
Are there any other options
with the Tesseract?

1162
01:37:34,122 --> 01:37:35,857
No, no, no. There's
no other options.

1163
01:37:35,905 --> 01:37:38,031
There's no do-overs. We're
not going anywhere else.

1164
01:37:38,062 --> 01:37:40,508
We have one particle left. Each.

1165
01:37:40,533 --> 01:37:44,199
That's it, alright? We use that...
Bye, bye. You're not going home.

1166
01:37:44,242 --> 01:37:46,432
Yeah, well if we don't try...

1167
01:37:46,489 --> 01:37:48,277
then no one else is
going home, either.

1168
01:37:48,302 --> 01:37:49,458
I got it.

1169
01:37:49,856 --> 01:37:54,218
There's another way. To retake the
Tesseract and acquire new particles.

1170
01:37:54,992 --> 01:37:58,792
We'll stroll down memory lane.
Military installation, Garden State.

1171
01:38:02,465 --> 01:38:03,856
Why were they both there?

1172
01:38:03,881 --> 01:38:07,093
They were there at a... I've
a vaguely exact idea.

1173
01:38:07,117 --> 01:38:07,914
How vague?

1174
01:38:07,970 --> 01:38:09,369
What are you talking about?
Where are we going?

1175
01:38:09,394 --> 01:38:10,598
- I know for a fact they were there...
- Who's they?

1176
01:38:10,621 --> 01:38:13,347
- What are we doing?
- And I know how I know.

1177
01:38:14,246 --> 01:38:16,309
Guys, what's up? What is it?

1178
01:38:16,475 --> 01:38:18,263
Well, it looks like
we're improvising.

1179
01:38:18,288 --> 01:38:19,787
- Right.
- What are we improvising?

1180
01:38:19,812 --> 01:38:21,907
Scott, get this back
to the compound.

1181
01:38:21,932 --> 01:38:22,643
Suit up.

1182
01:38:22,675 --> 01:38:23,822
What's in New Jersey?

1183
01:38:23,848 --> 01:38:25,723
- 0-4, 0-4...
- Uhh, 0-7.

1184
01:38:25,748 --> 01:38:26,817
- 0-7.
- Excuse me...

1185
01:38:26,843 --> 01:38:28,327
1-9-7-0.

1186
01:38:28,883 --> 01:38:33,237
- Are you sure?
- Cap. Captain. Steve, sorry.

1187
01:38:33,601 --> 01:38:36,501
America. Rogers. Look,
if you do this,

1188
01:38:36,536 --> 01:38:39,553
and this doesn't work,
you're not coming back.

1189
01:38:40,398 --> 01:38:42,599
Thanks for the pep
talk, pissant.

1190
01:38:43,212 --> 01:38:44,478
You trust me?

1191
01:38:44,994 --> 01:38:46,120
I do.

1192
01:38:47,598 --> 01:38:48,856
Your call.

1193
01:38:49,771 --> 01:38:51,147
Here we go.

1194
01:39:07,299 --> 01:39:08,745
Hey, man!

1195
01:39:09,046 --> 01:39:10,577
Make love, not war!

1196
01:39:17,260 --> 01:39:19,904
Clearly, you weren't
actually born here, right?

1197
01:39:19,929 --> 01:39:21,544
The idea of me was.

1198
01:39:22,295 --> 01:39:24,858
Right. Well, imagine
you're SHIELD, running a

1199
01:39:24,883 --> 01:39:27,774
quasi-fascistic
intelligence organization.

1200
01:39:28,823 --> 01:39:29,963
Where do you hide it?

1201
01:39:30,423 --> 01:39:31,637
In plain sight.

1202
01:40:00,628 --> 01:40:02,103
Good luck on your
mission, Captain.

1203
01:40:02,128 --> 01:40:04,373
Good luck on your
project, doctor.

1204
01:40:08,032 --> 01:40:09,376
You're new here?

1205
01:40:11,596 --> 01:40:12,800
Not exactly.

1206
01:40:28,282 --> 01:40:29,492
Gotcha.

1207
01:40:47,311 --> 01:40:48,695
Back in the game.

1208
01:40:51,705 --> 01:40:53,464
Arnim, you in there?

1209
01:40:53,777 --> 01:40:54,925
Arnim?

1210
01:41:00,156 --> 01:41:01,156
Hey!

1211
01:41:01,532 --> 01:41:03,454
The door's this way, pal.

1212
01:41:04,518 --> 01:41:05,573
Oh, yeah.

1213
01:41:05,841 --> 01:41:07,614
I'm looking for Dr. Zola.
Have you seen him?

1214
01:41:07,639 --> 01:41:11,476
Yeah, no, Dr. Zol... No,
I haven't seen a soul.

1215
01:41:12,706 --> 01:41:13,894
Pardon me.

1216
01:41:14,809 --> 01:41:16,310
Do I know you?

1217
01:41:17,756 --> 01:41:19,803
No, sir. I'm, a...

1218
01:41:20,226 --> 01:41:21,719
visitor from MIT.

1219
01:41:21,859 --> 01:41:23,579
Huh. MIT.

1220
01:41:24,189 --> 01:41:25,495
Got a name?

1221
01:41:25,886 --> 01:41:26,950
Howard.

1222
01:41:26,975 --> 01:41:28,591
Well that'll be
easy to remember.

1223
01:41:28,607 --> 01:41:30,084
Howard...

1224
01:41:30,748 --> 01:41:31,960
...Potts.

1225
01:41:31,985 --> 01:41:33,945
Well, I'm Howard Stark.

1226
01:41:34,578 --> 01:41:35,415
Hi.

1227
01:41:35,423 --> 01:41:36,759
Shit. Now, don't pull it.

1228
01:41:36,815 --> 01:41:37,816
Yeah...

1229
01:41:39,527 --> 01:41:41,678
You look a little green around
the gills there, Potts.

1230
01:41:41,733 --> 01:41:43,608
I'm fine. Just, long hours.

1231
01:41:44,140 --> 01:41:45,836
Wanna get some air?

1232
01:41:48,346 --> 01:41:51,090
- Hello, Potts.
- Yeah. That would be swell.

1233
01:41:51,160 --> 01:41:52,544
- That way.
- Okay.

1234
01:41:52,763 --> 01:41:54,342
Need your briefcase?

1235
01:41:59,095 --> 01:42:01,456
You're not one of
those, are ya, Potts?

1236
01:42:07,311 --> 01:42:09,054
- Hello.
- Dr. Pym?

1237
01:42:09,079 --> 01:42:11,722
That would be the number
that you called. Yes.

1238
01:42:11,747 --> 01:42:14,145
This is Capt. Stevens
from shipping.

1239
01:42:14,170 --> 01:42:16,724
- We have a package for you.
- Bring it up.

1240
01:42:16,749 --> 01:42:19,165
Well, that's the thing, sir.
We can't.

1241
01:42:20,031 --> 01:42:22,658
I'm confused. I thought
that was your job.

1242
01:42:22,806 --> 01:42:26,089
Well, it's just... Sir,
the box is glowing and,

1243
01:42:26,114 --> 01:42:28,803
to be honest, some of our mail
guys aren't feeling that great.

1244
01:42:28,828 --> 01:42:30,577
They didn't know
better, did they?

1245
01:42:30,602 --> 01:42:33,189
Yeah, they did. You
better get down here.

1246
01:42:33,784 --> 01:42:36,317
Excuse me. Out of the way!

1247
01:43:02,906 --> 01:43:06,353
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You
got a big date tonight?

1248
01:43:07,037 --> 01:43:08,703
My wife's expecting.

1249
01:43:08,977 --> 01:43:11,573
And, uh... Too much
time in the office.

1250
01:43:13,480 --> 01:43:15,815
- Congratulations.
- Thanks. Hold this, will you?

1251
01:43:15,840 --> 01:43:17,450
Yeah, sure.

1252
01:43:18,213 --> 01:43:20,511
- How far along is she?
- I don't know... uh...

1253
01:43:22,112 --> 01:43:25,153
She's at the point where she can't
stand the sound of my chewing.

1254
01:43:25,223 --> 01:43:28,217
I guess I'll be eating
dinner in the pantry again.

1255
01:43:29,231 --> 01:43:30,570
I have a little girl.

1256
01:43:30,595 --> 01:43:34,418
A girl would be nice. Less of a chance
she'd turn out exactly like me.

1257
01:43:34,966 --> 01:43:36,542
What'd be so awful about that?

1258
01:43:36,567 --> 01:43:39,898
Let's just say that the greater
good has rarely outweighed

1259
01:43:40,655 --> 01:43:42,843
my own self-interests.

1260
01:43:45,744 --> 01:43:48,136
- And you've never seen these 2 men before?
- No, I've got an eye for this.

1261
01:43:48,161 --> 01:43:50,054
- The 2 of them looked fishy.
- Can you describe them?

1262
01:43:50,079 --> 01:43:53,432
- Well, one of them had a hippie beard.
- Hippie? Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry?

1263
01:43:53,457 --> 01:43:54,522
Definitely Mungo Jerry.

1264
01:43:54,547 --> 01:43:56,728
Yeah, this is Chesler. I
need every available MPs

1265
01:43:56,753 --> 01:43:59,003
on sub-level 6. We have
a potential breach.

1266
01:45:00,837 --> 01:45:02,541
So, where are you
at with names?

1267
01:45:02,566 --> 01:45:05,622
Well, if it's a boy,
my wife likes Almanzo.

1268
01:45:06,568 --> 01:45:08,850
Might wanna let that stew on.
You got time.

1269
01:45:10,681 --> 01:45:12,662
Let me ask you a question.

1270
01:45:13,117 --> 01:45:15,282
When your kid was born...

1271
01:45:15,568 --> 01:45:18,635
- were you nervous?
- Wildly. Yeah.

1272
01:45:18,659 --> 01:45:20,042
Did you feel qualified?

1273
01:45:20,067 --> 01:45:23,623
Like you had any idea how to
successfully operate that thing?

1274
01:45:23,816 --> 01:45:26,896
I literally pieced it
together as I went along,

1275
01:45:26,951 --> 01:45:29,554
I thought about what
my Dad did, and...

1276
01:45:29,757 --> 01:45:32,657
My old man, he never met a problem
he couldn't solve with a belt.

1277
01:45:32,782 --> 01:45:34,877
I thought my Dad
was tough on me.

1278
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:37,909
And now, looking back, I just
remember the good stuff, you know.

1279
01:45:37,965 --> 01:45:41,098
- He did drop the odd pearl.
- Yeah? Like what?

1280
01:45:42,009 --> 01:45:44,761
"No amount of money ever
bought a second of time."

1281
01:45:45,824 --> 01:45:47,216
Smart guy.

1282
01:45:47,240 --> 01:45:48,661
He did his best.

1283
01:45:50,099 --> 01:45:51,866
Let me tell you. That
kid's not even here yet

1284
01:45:51,892 --> 01:45:54,220
and, there's nothing I
wouldn't do for him.

1285
01:46:02,517 --> 01:46:03,955
Good to meet you, Potts.

1286
01:46:04,917 --> 01:46:07,145
Yeah, Howard...

1287
01:46:08,040 --> 01:46:10,049
Everything's gonna be all right.

1288
01:46:12,255 --> 01:46:15,765
Thank you for everything...

1289
01:46:16,024 --> 01:46:18,610
...you've done for
this country.

1290
01:46:21,370 --> 01:46:22,535
Jarvis.

1291
01:46:26,233 --> 01:46:27,905
Have we ever met that guy?

1292
01:46:34,161 --> 01:46:35,989
Seems very familiar.

1293
01:46:36,779 --> 01:46:38,326
Weird beard, though.

1294
01:46:46,462 --> 01:46:49,200
- You're weak.
- I'm you.

1295
01:47:06,651 --> 01:47:08,112
You can stop this.

1296
01:47:08,863 --> 01:47:10,669
You know you want to.

1297
01:47:11,740 --> 01:47:14,342
Did you see what
happens in the future?

1298
01:47:15,016 --> 01:47:17,502
Thanos finds the Soul Stone.

1299
01:47:18,917 --> 01:47:21,051
You wanna know
how he does that?

1300
01:47:22,146 --> 01:47:26,906
You wanna know, what
he does to you?

1301
01:47:27,054 --> 01:47:28,423
That's enough.

1302
01:47:40,560 --> 01:47:42,006
You disgust me.

1303
01:47:43,468 --> 01:47:48,119
But, that doesn't
mean you're useless.

1304
01:48:10,210 --> 01:48:11,750
How do I look?

1305
01:48:18,505 --> 01:48:19,506
Wow...

1306
01:48:20,311 --> 01:48:22,655
Under different circumstances,

1307
01:48:23,513 --> 01:48:25,751
this would be totally awesome.

1308
01:48:37,676 --> 01:48:40,803
I bet the raccoon didn't
have to climb a mountain.

1309
01:48:40,934 --> 01:48:42,920
Technically, he's not
a raccoon, you know.

1310
01:48:42,945 --> 01:48:44,564
Whatever. He eats garbage.

1311
01:48:44,858 --> 01:48:45,859
Welcome.

1312
01:48:49,213 --> 01:48:51,933
Natasha, daughter of Ivan.

1313
01:48:52,932 --> 01:48:55,864
Clint, son of Edith.

1314
01:49:02,051 --> 01:49:03,168
Who are you?

1315
01:49:04,185 --> 01:49:06,381
Consider me a guide.

1316
01:49:06,723 --> 01:49:10,330
To you, and to all who
seek the Soul Stone.

1317
01:49:10,436 --> 01:49:13,867
Okay. You tell us where it is.
Then we'll be on our way.

1318
01:49:17,636 --> 01:49:19,589
If only it were that easy.

1319
01:49:32,121 --> 01:49:35,045
What you seek lies
in front of you...

1320
01:49:37,055 --> 01:49:38,876
...as does what you fear.

1321
01:49:44,555 --> 01:49:46,156
The stone is down there.

1322
01:49:46,947 --> 01:49:48,104
For one of you.

1323
01:49:49,293 --> 01:49:50,489
For the other...

1324
01:49:53,499 --> 01:49:57,955
In order to take the stone, you
must lose that which you love.

1325
01:49:59,923 --> 01:50:02,104
An everlasting exchange.

1326
01:50:04,176 --> 01:50:07,201
A soul, for a soul.

1327
01:50:10,680 --> 01:50:12,087
How's it going?

1328
01:50:15,723 --> 01:50:16,723
Jesus...

1329
01:50:17,364 --> 01:50:19,506
Maybe he's making this shit up.

1330
01:50:19,733 --> 01:50:23,142
No. I don't think so.

1331
01:50:23,931 --> 01:50:25,979
Why, 'cause he knows
your Daddy's name?

1332
01:50:27,622 --> 01:50:28,738
I didn't.

1333
01:50:29,934 --> 01:50:32,061
Thanos left here with the stone

1334
01:50:33,156 --> 01:50:36,643
without his daughter.
It's not a coincidence.

1335
01:50:38,034 --> 01:50:39,035
Yeah.

1336
01:50:41,090 --> 01:50:43,163
Whatever it takes.

1337
01:50:47,705 --> 01:50:48,987
Whatever it takes.

1338
01:50:53,513 --> 01:50:57,461
If we don't get that stone,
billions of people stay dead.

1339
01:51:01,194 --> 01:51:03,742
Then I guess we both
know who it's gotta be.

1340
01:51:04,103 --> 01:51:05,556
I guess we do.

1341
01:51:12,338 --> 01:51:16,763
I'm starting to think, we've been
different people here, Natasha.

1342
01:51:17,178 --> 01:51:20,586
For the last five years I've been trying
to do one thing: Get to right here.

1343
01:51:20,664 --> 01:51:22,938
That's all it's been about.
Bringing everybody back.

1344
01:51:22,963 --> 01:51:27,512
- Oh, don't you get all decent on me now.
- What, you think I wanna do it?

1345
01:51:27,920 --> 01:51:29,925
I'm trying to save
your life, you idiot.

1346
01:51:29,950 --> 01:51:32,099
Yeah well, I don't want
you to, because I...

1347
01:51:33,090 --> 01:51:35,292
Natasha, you know
what I've done.

1348
01:51:36,765 --> 01:51:39,031
You know what I've become.

1349
01:51:40,837 --> 01:51:43,518
I don't judge people on
their worst mistakes.

1350
01:51:47,709 --> 01:51:49,046
Maybe you should.

1351
01:51:49,921 --> 01:51:51,016
You didn't.

1352
01:51:57,420 --> 01:51:59,843
You're a pain in my
ass, you know that?

1353
01:52:10,734 --> 01:52:11,875
Okay.

1354
01:52:13,861 --> 01:52:15,096
You win.

1355
01:52:21,760 --> 01:52:23,561
Tell my family I love them.

1356
01:52:26,526 --> 01:52:28,082
You tell them yourself.

1357
01:53:00,857 --> 01:53:01,983
Damn you!

1358
01:53:18,199 --> 01:53:19,443
Let me go.

1359
01:53:21,339 --> 01:53:22,340
No.

1360
01:53:24,402 --> 01:53:25,529
Please, no.

1361
01:53:28,427 --> 01:53:30,021
It's okay.

1362
01:53:32,710 --> 01:53:33,747
Please...

1363
01:55:17,713 --> 01:55:19,011
Did we get them all?

1364
01:55:19,628 --> 01:55:22,028
You telling me this'll
actually work?

1365
01:55:26,748 --> 01:55:28,311
Clint, where's Nat?

1366
01:55:57,516 --> 01:55:59,450
Do we know if she had family?

1367
01:55:59,549 --> 01:56:01,714
Yeah. Us.

1368
01:56:03,286 --> 01:56:04,434
What?

1369
01:56:06,710 --> 01:56:07,992
I just asked him a question...

1370
01:56:08,017 --> 01:56:10,141
Yeah, you're acting like she's dead.
Why are we acting like she's dead?

1371
01:56:10,166 --> 01:56:12,074
We have the stones, right?
As long as we have

1372
01:56:12,099 --> 01:56:14,435
the stones, Cap, we can bring
her back, isn't that right?

1373
01:56:14,460 --> 01:56:16,805
So stop this shit. We're the
Avengers, get it together.

1374
01:56:16,830 --> 01:56:18,641
We can't get her back.

1375
01:56:21,370 --> 01:56:25,436
- Wha-what?
- It can't be undone. It can't.

1376
01:56:28,042 --> 01:56:31,907
I'm sorry. No offense, but you're
a very earthly being. Okay?

1377
01:56:31,932 --> 01:56:35,325
We're talking about space magic.
And "can't" seems very () don't you think?

1378
01:56:35,356 --> 01:56:38,358
Look, I know that I'm way
outside my paygrade here.

1379
01:56:38,366 --> 01:56:39,929
But she still isn't
here, is she?

1380
01:56:39,954 --> 01:56:43,885
- Now that's my point.
- It can't be undone.

1381
01:56:44,393 --> 01:56:47,746
Or that's at least what the,
great floating guy had to say.

1382
01:56:47,770 --> 01:56:49,418
Maybe you wanna go talk to him?
Okay?

1383
01:56:49,443 --> 01:56:52,883
Go grab your hammer, and you
go fly and you talk to him.

1384
01:57:00,899 --> 01:57:02,899
It was supposed to be me.

1385
01:57:05,558 --> 01:57:09,608
She sacrificed her life for that
goddamned stone. She bet her life on it.

1386
01:57:14,161 --> 01:57:16,068
She's not coming back.

1387
01:57:18,390 --> 01:57:21,220
We have to make it worth it.
We have to.

1388
01:57:23,250 --> 01:57:24,368
We will.

1389
01:57:49,646 --> 01:57:50,725
Boom!

1390
01:57:56,237 --> 01:57:58,175
All right. The glove's ready.

1391
01:57:58,612 --> 01:58:01,348
Question is, who's gonna
snap their freaking fingers?

1392
01:58:01,762 --> 01:58:02,762
I'll do it.

1393
01:58:03,350 --> 01:58:04,350
It's okay.

1394
01:58:04,374 --> 01:58:06,148
- No, no, no, no. Stop. Stop.
- Hey, hey...

1395
01:58:06,165 --> 01:58:07,141
Thor, just wait.

1396
01:58:07,166 --> 01:58:09,378
We haven't decided who's
gonna put that on yet.

1397
01:58:09,871 --> 01:58:12,779
I'm sorry. What, were you just sitting
around waiting for the right opportunity?

1398
01:58:12,826 --> 01:58:14,139
We should at least discuss it.

1399
01:58:14,148 --> 01:58:17,993
Look, us sitting here staring at that
thing is not gonna bring everybody back.

1400
01:58:19,022 --> 01:58:22,199
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So
this responsibility falls upon me.

1401
01:58:22,224 --> 01:58:27,392
It's my duty. It's not that... It's...
stop it! Just let me.

1402
01:58:29,891 --> 01:58:33,550
Just let me do it. Just
let me do something good.

1403
01:58:33,575 --> 01:58:34,394
- Something great.
- Look...

1404
01:58:34,410 --> 01:58:36,349
It's not just the fact that
that glove is channeling

1405
01:58:36,374 --> 01:58:39,077
enough energy to light up a
continent, I'm telling you

1406
01:58:39,101 --> 01:58:40,102
you're in no condition.

1407
01:58:40,141 --> 01:58:43,432
What do you think is coursing
through my veins right now?

1408
01:58:43,457 --> 01:58:44,675
Cheez Whiz?

1409
01:58:47,359 --> 01:58:49,029
- Lightning.
- Yeah.

1410
01:58:49,087 --> 01:58:51,001
Lightning won't help you, pal.

1411
01:58:51,065 --> 01:58:52,440
It's gotta be me.

1412
01:58:54,153 --> 01:58:57,639
You saw what those stones did to Thanos.
It almost killed him.

1413
01:58:59,617 --> 01:59:01,438
None of you could survive.

1414
01:59:01,890 --> 01:59:03,836
How do we know you will?

1415
01:59:03,852 --> 01:59:07,605
I don't. But the
radiation's mostly gamma.

1416
01:59:11,003 --> 01:59:12,356
It's like...

1417
01:59:14,661 --> 01:59:16,397
I was meant for this.

1418
01:59:35,440 --> 01:59:37,270
Good to go, yeah?

1419
01:59:39,037 --> 01:59:40,459
Let's do it.

1420
01:59:40,601 --> 01:59:42,679
You remember everyone
Thanos snapped away five

1421
01:59:42,704 --> 01:59:45,542
years ago and just bringing
them back to now, today.

1422
01:59:46,251 --> 01:59:48,643
Don't change anything
from the last five years.

1423
01:59:48,792 --> 01:59:49,793
Got it.

1424
02:00:06,647 --> 02:00:09,422
Friday, do me a favor and
activate protocol 8.

1425
02:00:09,462 --> 02:00:10,610
Yes, boss.

1426
02:00:19,280 --> 02:00:20,921
Everybody comes home.

1427
02:00:44,315 --> 02:00:47,684
- Take it off. Take it off!
- No, wait. Bruce, are you okay?

1428
02:00:48,310 --> 02:00:49,654
Talk to me, Banner.

1429
02:00:53,220 --> 02:00:55,722
I'm okay. I'm okay.

1430
02:01:27,182 --> 02:01:28,203
Bruce!

1431
02:01:29,680 --> 02:01:31,393
Don't move him.

1432
02:01:38,481 --> 02:01:41,256
- Did it work?
- Worth a shot. It's over. It's okay.

1433
02:02:26,829 --> 02:02:27,775
Honey.

1434
02:02:29,019 --> 02:02:30,020
Honey.

1435
02:02:31,325 --> 02:02:32,326
Guys...

1436
02:02:35,127 --> 02:02:36,846
I think it worked!

1437
02:03:18,270 --> 02:03:20,567
I can't breathe. I can't breathe!
I can't breathe.

1438
02:03:21,794 --> 02:03:24,147
Canopy. Canopy. Canopy.

1439
02:03:30,574 --> 02:03:32,850
Rhodey, Rocket, get outta here!

1440
02:03:33,425 --> 02:03:34,957
Hurry up! Hurry up!

1441
02:03:35,269 --> 02:03:36,365
Come on!

1442
02:03:46,457 --> 02:03:47,848
Rhodey!

1443
02:03:56,042 --> 02:03:59,849
Mayday, mayday! Does anybody copy? We're
in the lower level, it's flooding!

1444
02:03:59,881 --> 02:04:03,416
- What?
- We're drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday!

1445
02:04:03,535 --> 02:04:07,499
Wait! I'm here! I'm
here, can you hear me?

1446
02:04:27,083 --> 02:04:28,083
Cap?

1447
02:05:12,714 --> 02:05:13,715
Daughter.

1448
02:05:13,778 --> 02:05:15,091
Yes, Father.

1449
02:05:17,022 --> 02:05:20,274
So, this is the future.
Well done.

1450
02:05:20,783 --> 02:05:24,331
Thank you, Father. They
suspected nothing.

1451
02:05:26,419 --> 02:05:28,639
The arrogant never do.

1452
02:05:30,719 --> 02:05:31,720
Go.

1453
02:05:32,680 --> 02:05:35,228
Find the stones.
Bring them to me.

1454
02:05:35,494 --> 02:05:36,886
What will you do?

1455
02:05:38,356 --> 02:05:39,482
Wait.

1456
02:06:05,483 --> 02:06:07,375
Tell me something.

1457
02:06:08,031 --> 02:06:12,416
In the future, what
happens to you and me?

1458
02:06:14,959 --> 02:06:16,436
I tried to kill you.

1459
02:06:18,320 --> 02:06:19,492
Several times.

1460
02:06:20,955 --> 02:06:24,214
But eventually,
we become friends.

1461
02:06:26,450 --> 02:06:28,162
We become sisters.

1462
02:06:35,687 --> 02:06:36,920
Come on.

1463
02:06:38,814 --> 02:06:40,284
We can stop him.

1464
02:06:48,886 --> 02:06:50,487
Come on, buddy. Wake up.

1465
02:06:50,685 --> 02:06:52,083
That's my man.

1466
02:06:53,178 --> 02:06:55,664
You lose this again,
I'm keeping it.

1467
02:06:58,604 --> 02:06:59,972
What happened?

1468
02:07:00,157 --> 02:07:02,306
We messed with time.
It tends to mess back.

1469
02:07:02,331 --> 02:07:03,332
You'll see.

1470
02:07:25,124 --> 02:07:26,976
What's he been doing?

1471
02:07:28,492 --> 02:07:30,079
Absolutely nothing.

1472
02:07:31,784 --> 02:07:33,300
Where are the stones?

1473
02:07:33,823 --> 02:07:35,786
Lost somewhere under all this.

1474
02:07:37,006 --> 02:07:39,312
All I know is he
doesn't have them.

1475
02:07:39,640 --> 02:07:41,234
So we keep it that way.

1476
02:07:41,259 --> 02:07:43,714
- You know it's a trap, right?
- Yeah...

1477
02:07:44,409 --> 02:07:45,886
I don't much care.

1478
02:07:46,450 --> 02:07:47,450
Good.

1479
02:07:48,607 --> 02:07:51,209
Just as long as we're
all in agreement.

1480
02:08:00,881 --> 02:08:03,150
Let's kill him
properly this time.

1481
02:08:12,179 --> 02:08:14,914
You could not live
with your own failure.

1482
02:08:16,635 --> 02:08:18,402
Where did that bring you?

1483
02:08:21,538 --> 02:08:22,860
Back to me.

1484
02:08:26,792 --> 02:08:29,395
I thought by eliminating
half of life,

1485
02:08:30,215 --> 02:08:32,481
the other half would thrive.

1486
02:08:32,850 --> 02:08:37,361
But you've shown me,
that's impossible.

1487
02:08:38,991 --> 02:08:42,376
And as long as there are those
that remember what was,

1488
02:08:42,401 --> 02:08:47,647
there will always be those that
are unable to accept what can be.

1489
02:08:48,342 --> 02:08:49,757
They will resist.

1490
02:08:50,054 --> 02:08:52,256
Yep. We're all
kinds of stubborn.

1491
02:08:52,986 --> 02:08:54,612
I'm thankful.

1492
02:08:56,778 --> 02:09:00,686
Because now, I know
what I must do.

1493
02:09:01,359 --> 02:09:06,619
I will shred this universe
down to its last atom.

1494
02:09:07,402 --> 02:09:08,817
And then...

1495
02:09:09,142 --> 02:09:14,035
With the stones you've collected
for me, create a new one.

1496
02:09:14,568 --> 02:09:16,366
Teeming with life,

1497
02:09:16,727 --> 02:09:21,386
but knows not what it has lost
but only what it has been given.

1498
02:09:24,152 --> 02:09:25,762
A grateful universe.

1499
02:09:26,284 --> 02:09:27,755
Born out of blood.

1500
02:09:27,912 --> 02:09:29,585
They'll never know it.

1501
02:09:30,616 --> 02:09:33,285
Because you won't be
alive to tell them.

1502
02:09:48,525 --> 02:09:50,135
See you on the other side, man.

1503
02:09:51,762 --> 02:09:53,997
Hang on! I'm coming!

1504
02:10:39,945 --> 02:10:41,431
Oh, hey...

1505
02:10:41,486 --> 02:10:43,190
I know you.

1506
02:10:46,426 --> 02:10:49,662
Father. I have the stones.

1507
02:10:49,741 --> 02:10:50,742
What?!

1508
02:10:51,969 --> 02:10:53,078
Stop.

1509
02:10:58,034 --> 02:10:59,855
You're betraying us?

1510
02:11:05,563 --> 02:11:07,431
You don't have to do this.

1511
02:11:09,698 --> 02:11:12,621
I am... this.

1512
02:11:12,653 --> 02:11:14,506
No, you're not.

1513
02:11:14,670 --> 02:11:16,718
You've seen what we become.

1514
02:11:22,765 --> 02:11:24,220
Nebula, listen to her.

1515
02:11:26,574 --> 02:11:27,847
You can change.

1516
02:11:34,030 --> 02:11:35,383
He won't let me.

1517
02:11:37,157 --> 02:11:38,157
No!

1518
02:11:57,416 --> 02:11:59,418
Okay, Thor. Hit me.

1519
02:12:15,389 --> 02:12:16,898
Boss, wake up.

1520
02:13:08,014 --> 02:13:09,249
I knew it!

1521
02:14:32,108 --> 02:14:34,446
In all my years of conquest...

1522
02:14:35,713 --> 02:14:36,956
violence...

1523
02:14:38,668 --> 02:14:39,856
slaughter...

1524
02:14:41,756 --> 02:14:43,390
It was never personal.

1525
02:14:46,830 --> 02:14:48,557
But I'll tell you now...

1526
02:14:51,000 --> 02:14:53,535
what I'm about to do
to your stubborn,

1527
02:14:54,346 --> 02:14:56,574
annoying little planet...

1528
02:14:58,817 --> 02:15:03,624
I'm gonna enjoy it.
Very, very much.

1529
02:16:08,085 --> 02:16:09,593
Cap, you hear me?

1530
02:16:15,085 --> 02:16:17,446
Cap, it's Sam.
Can you hear me?

1531
02:16:21,687 --> 02:16:22,938
On your left.

1532
02:17:48,557 --> 02:17:49,924
Is that everyone?

1533
02:17:50,222 --> 02:17:51,754
What, you wanted more?

1534
02:18:18,875 --> 02:18:20,321
Avengers...

1535
02:18:25,798 --> 02:18:27,056
...assemble.

1536
02:19:23,850 --> 02:19:25,366
No, no. Give me that.

1537
02:19:25,404 --> 02:19:26,977
You have the little one.

1538
02:19:40,514 --> 02:19:41,515
Hey!

1539
02:19:42,430 --> 02:19:43,461
Holy cow.

1540
02:19:43,509 --> 02:19:46,729
You will not believe what's been going on.
Do you remember when we were in space?

1541
02:19:46,754 --> 02:19:50,466
And I got all dusty? I must've passed
out, 'cause I woke up, and you were gone.

1542
02:19:50,491 --> 02:19:52,460
But Doctor Strange was there, right?
He was like,

1543
02:19:52,485 --> 02:19:54,364
"It's been five years.
Come on, they need us!"

1544
02:19:54,389 --> 02:19:56,896
And then he started doing the yellow
sparkly thing that he does all the time...

1545
02:19:56,921 --> 02:19:58,632
What are you doing?

1546
02:20:03,245 --> 02:20:04,402
This is nice.

1547
02:20:26,586 --> 02:20:27,845
Gamora?

1548
02:20:36,860 --> 02:20:38,455
I thought I lost you.

1549
02:20:43,247 --> 02:20:45,983
Don't... touch... me!

1550
02:20:49,140 --> 02:20:50,726
You missed the first time...

1551
02:20:51,298 --> 02:20:53,830
then you got them
both the second time.

1552
02:20:55,426 --> 02:20:57,700
This is the one? Seriously?

1553
02:20:57,769 --> 02:20:59,950
The choices were him, or a tree.

1554
02:21:10,607 --> 02:21:13,929
Cap, what do you want me to
do with this damn thing?

1555
02:21:15,900 --> 02:21:18,260
Get those stones as
far away as possible!

1556
02:21:18,277 --> 02:21:19,394
No!

1557
02:21:20,403 --> 02:21:22,702
We need to get them back
where they came from.

1558
02:21:22,727 --> 02:21:25,368
No way to get them back. Thanos
destroyed the quantum tunnel.

1559
02:21:25,431 --> 02:21:26,533
Hold on!

1560
02:21:27,815 --> 02:21:30,144
That wasn't our
only time machine.

1561
02:21:36,089 --> 02:21:38,334
Anyone see an ugly
brown van up there?

1562
02:21:38,584 --> 02:21:39,365
Yes!

1563
02:21:39,412 --> 02:21:41,678
But you're not gonna
like where it's parked.

1564
02:21:41,703 --> 02:21:44,954
Scott, how long you need
to get that thing working?

1565
02:21:45,330 --> 02:21:46,530
Maybe ten minutes.

1566
02:21:46,534 --> 02:21:48,340
Get it started. We'll
get the stones to you.

1567
02:21:48,365 --> 02:21:49,873
We're on it, Cap.

1568
02:21:59,599 --> 02:22:00,600
Hey.

1569
02:22:00,920 --> 02:22:03,898
You said one out of 14
million, we win, yeah?

1570
02:22:04,945 --> 02:22:05,945
Tell me this is it.

1571
02:22:06,330 --> 02:22:09,597
If I tell you what
happens, it won't happen.

1572
02:22:13,262 --> 02:22:14,825
You better be right.

1573
02:22:22,619 --> 02:22:24,087
It's a mess back here.

1574
02:22:24,497 --> 02:22:26,912
It's... it's dead.

1575
02:22:27,099 --> 02:22:28,560
- What?
- It's dead.

1576
02:22:28,843 --> 02:22:30,469
I have to hotwire it.

1577
02:22:33,142 --> 02:22:34,644
Where's Nebula?

1578
02:22:35,293 --> 02:22:37,166
She's not responding.

1579
02:22:37,242 --> 02:22:38,243
Sire!

1580
02:22:48,255 --> 02:22:49,379
Clint!

1581
02:22:51,618 --> 02:22:52,813
Give it to me.

1582
02:23:15,134 --> 02:23:18,661
You took everything from me.

1583
02:23:18,786 --> 02:23:20,935
I don't even know who you are.

1584
02:23:21,327 --> 02:23:22,553
You will.

1585
02:23:45,118 --> 02:23:46,118
I got it!

1586
02:23:48,753 --> 02:23:50,417
Activate Instant Kill!

1587
02:24:13,828 --> 02:24:15,118
Rain fire!

1588
02:24:15,415 --> 02:24:17,665
But Sire, our troops!

1589
02:24:17,713 --> 02:24:18,971
Just do it!

1590
02:24:40,124 --> 02:24:41,742
Is anyone else seeing this?

1591
02:24:55,595 --> 02:24:56,673
I got this.

1592
02:24:56,876 --> 02:24:57,877
I got this!

1593
02:24:57,932 --> 02:24:59,245
Okay, I don't got this.

1594
02:24:59,253 --> 02:25:02,622
- Help! Somebody, help!
- Hey, Queens. Heads up.

1595
02:25:12,388 --> 02:25:14,256
Hang on. I got you, kid.

1596
02:25:17,179 --> 02:25:18,298
Hey! Nice to meet...

1597
02:25:18,320 --> 02:25:19,399
Oh! My God!

1598
02:25:56,831 --> 02:25:58,254
What the hell is this?

1599
02:25:58,645 --> 02:26:00,035
Friday, what are they firing at?

1600
02:26:00,060 --> 02:26:02,522
Something just entered
the upper atmosphere.

1601
02:26:15,328 --> 02:26:16,892
Oh, yeah!

1602
02:26:37,356 --> 02:26:39,788
Danvers, we need an assist here.

1603
02:26:48,435 --> 02:26:50,803
Hi. I'm Peter Parker.

1604
02:26:51,619 --> 02:26:54,807
Hey, Peter Parker. Got
something for me?

1605
02:27:00,446 --> 02:27:03,760
I don't know how you're
gonna get through all that.

1606
02:27:04,409 --> 02:27:05,589
Don't worry.

1607
02:27:06,567 --> 02:27:08,060
She's got help.

1608
02:29:55,816 --> 02:29:59,145
I am... inevitable.

1609
02:30:19,560 --> 02:30:20,638
And I...

1610
02:30:22,805 --> 02:30:24,016
am...

1611
02:30:27,682 --> 02:30:28,980
...Iron Man.

1612
02:32:25,810 --> 02:32:27,154
Mr. Stark?

1613
02:32:28,029 --> 02:32:29,030
Hey...

1614
02:32:30,187 --> 02:32:33,174
Mr. Stark? Can you hear me?

1615
02:32:33,219 --> 02:32:34,563
It's Peter.

1616
02:32:38,716 --> 02:32:40,177
We won.

1617
02:32:40,553 --> 02:32:41,553
Mr. Stark...

1618
02:32:43,578 --> 02:32:45,563
We won, Mr. Stark.

1619
02:32:47,102 --> 02:32:49,792
We won and you did it, sir.
You did it.

1620
02:32:51,394 --> 02:32:53,732
I'm sorry... Tony...

1621
02:33:07,314 --> 02:33:09,924
- Hey.
- Hey, Pep...

1622
02:33:14,565 --> 02:33:18,113
- Friday?
- Life functions critical.

1623
02:33:27,205 --> 02:33:28,292
Tony.

1624
02:33:29,605 --> 02:33:30,722
Look at me.

1625
02:33:33,248 --> 02:33:34,811
We're gonna be okay.

1626
02:33:39,892 --> 02:33:41,684
You can rest now.

1627
02:35:27,069 --> 02:35:29,610
Everybody wants a
happy ending, right?

1628
02:35:30,266 --> 02:35:32,668
But it doesn't always
roll that way.

1629
02:35:34,441 --> 02:35:35,801
Maybe this time.

1630
02:35:37,724 --> 02:35:40,319
I'm hoping if you
play this back,

1631
02:35:41,914 --> 02:35:43,657
it's in celebration.

1632
02:35:44,533 --> 02:35:46,739
I hope families are reunited,

1633
02:35:46,810 --> 02:35:49,046
I hope we get it back,
and something like a

1634
02:35:49,071 --> 02:35:51,553
normal version of the
planet has been restored.

1635
02:35:52,384 --> 02:35:54,767
If there ever was such a thing.

1636
02:35:55,034 --> 02:35:56,512
God, what a world.

1637
02:35:56,778 --> 02:35:58,489
Universe, now.

1638
02:35:59,146 --> 02:36:01,265
If you told me ten years
ago that we weren't alone,

1639
02:36:01,290 --> 02:36:02,789
let alone, you know,
to this extent,

1640
02:36:02,813 --> 02:36:06,416
I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised.
But come on, you know?

1641
02:36:06,745 --> 02:36:11,248
That epic forces of darkness and
light that have come into play.

1642
02:36:11,780 --> 02:36:13,448
And, for better or worse,

1643
02:36:13,612 --> 02:36:17,365
that's the reality Morgan's gonna
have to find a way to grow up in.

1644
02:36:21,261 --> 02:36:23,645
So I found the time and I
recorded a little greeting...

1645
02:36:23,733 --> 02:36:26,757
In the case of an untimely death.
On my part.

1646
02:36:27,078 --> 02:36:30,596
Not that, death in any
time isn't untimely.

1647
02:36:31,158 --> 02:36:33,547
This time travel thing that we're
gonna try and pull off tomorrow,

1648
02:36:33,572 --> 02:36:35,800
it's, it's got me scratching
my head about this.

1649
02:36:40,243 --> 02:36:43,628
But then again, that's the hero gig.
Part of the journey is the end.

1650
02:36:46,559 --> 02:36:50,718
Everything's gonna work out
exactly the way it's supposed to.

1651
02:36:54,013 --> 02:36:55,522
I love you 3,000.

1652
02:39:10,761 --> 02:39:12,880
You know, I wish
there was a way...

1653
02:39:12,974 --> 02:39:14,787
that I could let her know.

1654
02:39:16,772 --> 02:39:18,172
That we won.

1655
02:39:20,392 --> 02:39:21,634
We did it.

1656
02:39:25,653 --> 02:39:26,731
She knows.

1657
02:39:32,401 --> 02:39:33,681
They both do.

1658
02:39:43,354 --> 02:39:44,822
How you doing, Squirt?

1659
02:39:44,824 --> 02:39:46,911
- Good.
- You good?

1660
02:39:47,036 --> 02:39:49,772
- Okay. You hungry?
- Mm-hmm.

1661
02:39:50,320 --> 02:39:53,524
- What do you want?
- Cheeseburgers.

1662
02:39:58,219 --> 02:40:01,166
You know your Dad
liked cheeseburgers?

1663
02:40:04,723 --> 02:40:07,334
I'm gonna get you all the
cheeseburgers you want.

1664
02:40:07,350 --> 02:40:08,351
Okay.

1665
02:40:25,071 --> 02:40:28,808
So, when can we expect you back?

1666
02:40:31,123 --> 02:40:35,015
- About that...
- Thor. Your people need a king.

1667
02:40:35,131 --> 02:40:37,342
No, they already have one.

1668
02:40:39,164 --> 02:40:40,454
That's funny.

1669
02:40:45,528 --> 02:40:46,989
You're being serious?

1670
02:40:51,079 --> 02:40:53,363
It's time for me to be
who I am rather than

1671
02:40:53,948 --> 02:40:56,207
who I'm supposed to be.

1672
02:40:57,639 --> 02:41:01,546
But you, you're a leader.
That's who you are.

1673
02:41:04,201 --> 02:41:06,483
You know I'd make a lot
of changes around here.

1674
02:41:06,508 --> 02:41:09,690
I'm counting on it.
Your Majesty.

1675
02:41:19,755 --> 02:41:21,092
What will you do?

1676
02:41:21,475 --> 02:41:22,694
I'm not sure.

1677
02:41:23,336 --> 02:41:25,790
For the first time in a
thousand years, I...

1678
02:41:25,962 --> 02:41:28,612
I have no path. I do
have a ride, though.

1679
02:41:28,706 --> 02:41:30,934
Move it or lose it, hairbag.

1680
02:41:34,889 --> 02:41:36,421
Well, here we are.

1681
02:41:36,892 --> 02:41:39,080
Tree! Good to see you.

1682
02:41:41,316 --> 02:41:42,316
Well...

1683
02:41:43,175 --> 02:41:46,007
The As-Guardians of the
Galaxy back together again.

1684
02:41:47,050 --> 02:41:48,556
Where to first?

1685
02:41:51,596 --> 02:41:54,832
Just so you know, this is my ship still.
I'm in charge.

1686
02:41:55,175 --> 02:41:57,732
I know. I know. Of
course, you are.

1687
02:41:57,998 --> 02:41:59,210
Of course.

1688
02:42:01,782 --> 02:42:04,799
See, you say of course, but
then you touch the map.

1689
02:42:04,824 --> 02:42:07,708
It makes you think that maybe you
didn't realize I was in charge.

1690
02:42:07,810 --> 02:42:11,055
Quail, that's your own
insecurities in there. Okay?

1691
02:42:11,071 --> 02:42:13,266
I'm merely trying to be of service.
An assistant.

1692
02:42:13,291 --> 02:42:15,608
- Quill.
- That's what I said.

1693
02:42:15,633 --> 02:42:17,899
You should fight one another
for the honor of leadership.

1694
02:42:18,040 --> 02:42:19,470
Sounds fair.

1695
02:42:22,067 --> 02:42:23,755
- It's not necessary.
- It's not.

1696
02:42:23,771 --> 02:42:24,380
Okay?

1697
02:42:24,405 --> 02:42:27,047
I got some blasters unless
you guys wanna use knives.

1698
02:42:27,077 --> 02:42:29,571
Oh, yes. Please, use knives.

1699
02:42:30,454 --> 02:42:31,712
I am Groot.

1700
02:42:38,484 --> 02:42:39,485
Not necessary.

1701
02:42:39,532 --> 02:42:41,430
There shall be no
knifing one another.

1702
02:42:41,455 --> 02:42:44,066
Everybody knows who's in charge.

1703
02:42:47,732 --> 02:42:48,866
It's me.

1704
02:42:52,258 --> 02:42:55,159
Yes, you! Of course!

1705
02:42:55,526 --> 02:42:58,028
Of course. Of course.

1706
02:43:00,436 --> 02:43:01,522
Remember...

1707
02:43:02,904 --> 02:43:05,265
You have to return the stones at
the exact moment you got them.

1708
02:43:05,289 --> 02:43:08,955
Or you're gonna open up a bunch
of nasty alternative realities.

1709
02:43:09,017 --> 02:43:11,120
Don't worry, Bruce.
Clip all the branches.

1710
02:43:12,489 --> 02:43:13,974
You know, I tried.

1711
02:43:15,632 --> 02:43:19,352
When I had the gauntlet, the stones,
I really tried to bring her back.

1712
02:43:23,211 --> 02:43:26,455
- I miss them, man.
- Me, too.

1713
02:43:30,035 --> 02:43:33,006
You know, if you want,
I can come with you.

1714
02:43:35,291 --> 02:43:37,034
You're a good man, Sam.

1715
02:43:37,157 --> 02:43:39,204
This one's on me, though.

1716
02:43:43,122 --> 02:43:45,639
Don't do anything stupid
'till I get back.

1717
02:43:47,075 --> 02:43:50,272
How can I? You're taking
all the stupid with you.

1718
02:43:57,778 --> 02:43:59,309
Gonna miss you, Buddy.

1719
02:43:59,543 --> 02:44:01,404
It's gonna be okay, Buck.

1720
02:44:08,671 --> 02:44:10,765
How long is this gonna take?

1721
02:44:10,891 --> 02:44:13,688
For him? As long as he
needs, For us, five seconds.

1722
02:44:18,792 --> 02:44:20,043
Ready, Cap?

1723
02:44:20,340 --> 02:44:22,935
Alright. We'll meet
you back here, okay?

1724
02:44:23,100 --> 02:44:24,349
You bet.

1725
02:44:25,413 --> 02:44:30,299
Going quantum. Three..
two.. one...

1726
02:44:32,043 --> 02:44:39,023
And returning in, five,
four, three, two, one...

1727
02:44:46,384 --> 02:44:47,635
Where is he?

1728
02:44:47,682 --> 02:44:50,980
I don't know. He blew right by his
time stamp. He should be here.

1729
02:44:56,583 --> 02:44:57,948
- Well, get him back.
- I'm trying.

1730
02:44:57,973 --> 02:45:00,459
- Get him the hell back.
- I said, I'm trying!

1731
02:45:00,529 --> 02:45:01,615
Sam.

1732
02:45:24,821 --> 02:45:25,999
Go ahead.

1733
02:45:44,446 --> 02:45:45,447
Cap?

1734
02:45:47,370 --> 02:45:48,808
Hi, Sam.

1735
02:45:52,266 --> 02:45:55,213
So did something go wrong,
or did something go right?

1736
02:45:57,261 --> 02:46:00,889
Well, after I put the
stones back, I thought...

1737
02:46:02,390 --> 02:46:06,330
Maybe I'll try some
of that life Tony was...

1738
02:46:07,026 --> 02:46:08,886
telling me to get.

1739
02:46:11,006 --> 02:46:13,178
How did that work out for you?

1740
02:46:15,563 --> 02:46:16,954
It was beautiful.

1741
02:46:18,478 --> 02:46:20,994
I'm happy for you. Truly.

1742
02:46:21,958 --> 02:46:23,083
Thank you.

1743
02:46:24,624 --> 02:46:26,757
Only thing bumming me
out is the fact I have

1744
02:46:26,782 --> 02:46:29,267
to live in a world
without Captain America.

1745
02:46:30,205 --> 02:46:31,206
Oh...

1746
02:46:33,411 --> 02:46:34,723
That reminds me...

1747
02:46:44,599 --> 02:46:45,795
Try it on.

1748
02:47:11,308 --> 02:47:12,699
How's it feel?

1749
02:47:15,177 --> 02:47:17,178
Like it's someone else's.

1750
02:47:20,110 --> 02:47:21,276
It isn't.

1751
02:47:34,622 --> 02:47:35,833
Thank you.

1752
02:47:37,998 --> 02:47:39,444
I'll do my best.

1753
02:47:44,759 --> 02:47:46,355
That's why it's yours.

1754
02:47:48,404 --> 02:47:50,272
You wanna tell me about her?

1755
02:47:56,194 --> 02:47:57,195
No.

1756
02:47:58,194 --> 02:47:59,922
No, I don't think I will.
