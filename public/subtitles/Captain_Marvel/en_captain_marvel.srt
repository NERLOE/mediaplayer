Because I stared into

was my own.

I knew it!
Everyone said you were dead!

815

But we knew they were lying.

who you think I am.

absolutely right, young lady.

'Cause if there were,

822

we would want to keep that
to ourselves.

a lot more than make tea

(SIGHS) Maybe later.

831
00:58:23,084 --> 00:58:24,335
I kept all your stuff.

832
00:58:24,502 --> 00:58:25,670
I'll go get it.

833
00:58:26,671 --> 00:58:28,255
You want to give her
a hand with that?

834

Hmm?

835
00:58:44,647 --> 00:58:46,565
You don't remember anything?

But I can't tell what's real.

839
00:58:58,661 --> 00:59:01,956
If I could just piece together
what happened that morning...

840
00:59:02,498 --> 00:59:04,792
maybe it'll all make sense.

(CLICKS TONGUE)

842

Your usual move.

844
00:59:13,592 --> 00:59:16,011
Back then,
we had to get up so early.

845
00:59:16,512 --> 00:59:19,014
The Air Force still wasn't
letting women fly combat...

846
00:59:19,181 --> 00:59:21,726
so testing Lawson's planes
was our only shot

847
00:59:21,809 --> 00:59:23,018
at doing something
that mattered.

848
00:59:23,185 --> 00:59:25,938
You wanted to race to base
in your old Mustang...

849
00:59:26,063 --> 00:59:27,064
and I wasn't about to argue,

850
00:59:27,148 --> 00:59:28,941
'cause I knew
my Camaro would dominate.

851

But you cheated,
took a shortcut.

852
00:59:31,402 --> 00:59:32,945
Since when is
a shortcut cheating?

853
00:59:33,112 --> 00:59:34,155
Since it violates
the predetermined

don't remember those.

Hmm. Of course you don't.

(BOTH LAUGH)

858
00:59:43,247 --> 00:59:48,544
When I got to the hangar,
Lawson was agitated.

859
00:59:48,711 --> 00:59:51,756
She said
she had lives to save.

860
00:59:52,715 --> 00:59:54,133
She was trying
to take the Asis up herself,

861
00:59:54,216 --> 00:59:55,259
but you said that...

862
00:59:55,426 --> 00:59:58,971
If there were lives at stake,
I would fly the plane.

863
00:59:59,138 --> 01:00:03,392
Yeah. Yep. Big hero moment.

864
01:00:03,976 --> 01:00:06,979
The kind of moment
we'd both been waiting for.

The doc was always unique.
That's why we liked her.

But now you're saying
she's from another planet.

this must be hard for you.

No. No. Mmm-mmm.

Oh, what's hard
is losing my best friend...

01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,464
in a mission so secret

they act
like it never even happened.

873

Hard is knowing
you were out there somewhere

874
01:00:41,305 --> 01:00:43,182
too damn stubborn to die.

875

to call you...

we became your real family.

I had to take
some precautions.

974
01:04:49,553 --> 01:04:50,763
decoding some coordinates.

975
01:04:50,929 --> 01:04:52,765
If you'll sit down
and you'll listen to this...

976
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:56,101
I assure you,
it'll be worth your while.

977
01:04:58,812 --> 01:05:01,023
Call your buddy back inside
and I'll listen.

978
01:05:01,648 --> 01:05:02,649
Deal.

979
01:05:02,733 --> 01:05:03,776
(PURRING)

980
01:05:03,859 --> 01:05:05,736
Oh, my God!
Get that thing away.

981
01:05:05,903 --> 01:05:07,237
How'd that get in here?

982
01:05:07,321 --> 01:05:08,447
Hmm?

983
01:05:09,823 --> 01:05:10,824
- The cat?
- (WHIMPERS)

984
01:05:10,949 --> 01:05:12,076
This isn't what
you're afraid of, is it?

985
01:05:12,576 --> 01:05:13,702
That's not a cat.

986
01:05:14,745 --> 01:05:16,872
- That's a Flerken.
- FURY: A Flerken?

987
01:05:16,955 --> 01:05:18,582
- (LAUGHS)
- MONICA: Mom?

988
01:05:26,090 --> 01:05:27,091
MARIA: Monica.

989
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:28,801
- Why can't I listen, too?
- Shh!

990
01:05:56,620 --> 01:05:58,038
What's happening?

991
01:05:58,205 --> 01:05:59,790
It's loading.

992

01:06:15,597 --> 01:06:16,723

1001
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:24,690
That's no MiG, Lawson.
Who the hell are they?

1002
01:06:24,857 --> 01:06:26,859
Those are the bad guys.
Fly faster now!

1003
01:06:26,942 --> 01:06:27,943
Yes, ma'am.

1004
01:06:34,074 --> 01:06:36,160
- What do they want?
- Me. My work.

1005
01:06:36,368 --> 01:06:37,870
I never should have
brought you along.

1006
01:06:43,083 --> 01:06:44,084
Here come some G's.

1007
01:07:01,685 --> 01:07:02,769
(BEEPING)

1008
01:07:03,645 --> 01:07:05,355
They're firing backwards.
Hold on!

Bail out! Bail out! Bail out!

Yeah, but, uh, how's my hair?

1020
01:08:02,829 --> 01:08:05,207
Help me out, will ya?

1021
01:08:08,252 --> 01:08:11,296
I gotta destroy it
before they get here.

1022

VERS: Lawson?

1023
01:08:12,965 --> 01:08:16,718
You remember what I said about
our work here? What it's for?

1024
01:08:17,761 --> 01:08:18,971
To end wars?

1025
01:08:19,137 --> 01:08:22,766
Yeah. But the wars are bigger
than you know.

1026
01:08:23,976 --> 01:08:25,435
Damn it!

1027
01:08:26,061 --> 01:08:28,021
My name is not Lawson.

1028
01:08:28,480 --> 01:08:31,525
My real name is Mar-Vell,

1029
01:08:31,608 --> 01:08:34,403
and I come
from a planet called Hala.

1030
01:08:34,528 --> 01:08:35,654
(EXHALES)

1031
01:08:35,737 --> 01:08:37,781
I would say
that you're delusional...

1032
01:08:37,990 --> 01:08:39,574
but we just got shot down
by a spaceship

1033
01:08:39,658 --> 01:08:41,159
and your blood is blue.

1034
01:08:42,035 --> 01:08:45,872
Listen, I spent half my life
fighting a shameful war.

1035
01:08:46,039 --> 01:08:47,874
Now, skedaddle
before you give me

1036
01:08:47,958 --> 01:08:49,167
any more regrets.

1037
01:08:49,334 --> 01:08:51,420
Just remember
the coordinates, okay?

1038
01:08:52,004 --> 01:08:53,588
You gotta save 'em without me.

1039
01:08:53,755 --> 01:08:54,798
Save who? How?

1040
01:08:54,965 --> 01:08:57,843
Now I gotta blow this engine
before they find it.

1041
01:08:58,010 --> 01:08:59,303
What are you doing?

1042
01:09:00,220 --> 01:09:01,471
- (GUNSHOT)
- (GASPS)

1043
01:09:05,100 --> 01:09:06,768
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1044
01:09:19,239 --> 01:09:21,325
We have no interest
in hurting you.

1045
01:09:21,700 --> 01:09:23,035
No?

1046
01:09:23,201 --> 01:09:25,871
'Cause all the shooting kinda
gave me the wrong impression!

1047
01:09:27,414 --> 01:09:28,874
The energy core.

1048
01:09:29,708 --> 01:09:30,959
Where is it?

1049
01:09:31,126 --> 01:09:32,836
Pararescue's on the way.

1050
01:09:33,670 --> 01:09:35,547
You have two minutes
until you're surrounded.

1051
01:09:35,881 --> 01:09:38,508
Then I see no reason
to prolong this conversation.

1052
01:09:38,675 --> 01:09:39,718
VERS: No, wait!

1053
01:09:46,141 --> 01:09:47,517
You mean that energy core?

1054
01:09:52,064 --> 01:09:53,190
(SHOUTS) No!

1055
01:10:36,817 --> 01:10:40,195
Commander? She's still moving.
Permission to fire.

1056
01:10:40,362 --> 01:10:41,363
Hold your fire.

1057
01:10:51,373 --> 01:10:53,250
MINN-ERVA:
There's nothing left.

1058
01:10:53,417 --> 01:10:55,085
The core has been destroyed.

1059
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:06,680
YON-ROGG:
She absorbed its power.

1060
01:11:08,932 --> 01:11:10,725
She's coming with us.

1061
01:11:24,448 --> 01:11:27,117
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1062
01:11:31,580 --> 01:11:32,956
He lied to me.

1063
01:11:35,584 --> 01:11:37,544
Everything that I knew
was a lie.

1064
01:11:37,711 --> 01:11:40,213
Now, you understand.

1065
01:11:40,380 --> 01:11:42,883
What?
What do I understand now?

1066
01:11:43,049 --> 01:11:44,926
Yon-Rogg killed Mar-Vell.

1067
01:11:45,093 --> 01:11:46,219
He killed her...

1068
01:11:47,095 --> 01:11:48,889
'cause she found out
that she was

1069
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:52,184
on the wrong side
of an unjust war.

1070
01:11:52,267 --> 01:11:53,310
VERS: No.

1071
01:11:53,894 --> 01:11:56,021
Your people are terrorists.

1072
01:11:56,188 --> 01:11:57,689
They kill innocents.

1073
01:11:57,856 --> 01:11:59,608
I saw the ruins on Torfa.

1074
01:11:59,774 --> 01:12:03,028
Ruins that the Accusers
are responsible for.

1075
01:12:03,403 --> 01:12:06,698
My people lived as refugees
on Torfa.

1076
01:12:07,491 --> 01:12:10,452
Homeless, ever since
we resisted Kree rule...

1077
01:12:10,619 --> 01:12:12,621
and they destroyed our planet.

1078
01:12:12,787 --> 01:12:16,374
And the handful of us
that are left

1079
01:12:16,458 --> 01:12:18,502
will be slaughtered next...

1080
01:12:18,668 --> 01:12:22,672
unless you help me finish
what Mar-Vell started.

1081
01:12:23,965 --> 01:12:25,383
The core that she found

1082
01:12:25,467 --> 01:12:27,010
would have powered
a light-speed ship...

1083
01:12:27,177 --> 01:12:28,970
capable of carrying us
to safety.

1084
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:33,099
A new home where
the Kree can't reach us.

1085
01:12:34,601 --> 01:12:36,937
Lawson always told us
that our work at Pegasus

1086
01:12:37,020 --> 01:12:38,271
wasn't to fight wars...

1087
01:12:38,438 --> 01:12:39,439
but to end them.

1088
01:12:40,065 --> 01:12:45,612
She wanted you to help us
find the core.

1089
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:47,656
Well, I already destroyed it.

1090
01:12:47,822 --> 01:12:49,366
No, you destroyed the engine.

1091
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:52,536
The core that powered it
is in a remote location.

1092
01:12:52,702 --> 01:12:56,998
If you help us
decode those coordinates...

1093
01:12:57,165 --> 01:12:58,708
we can find it.

1094
01:13:00,502 --> 01:13:02,128
You'll use it to destroy us.

1095
01:13:04,422 --> 01:13:07,384
(SIGHS)
We just want a home.

1096
01:13:11,638 --> 01:13:16,851
You and I lost everything
at the hands of the Kree.

1097
01:13:17,018 --> 01:13:18,853
Can't you see it now?

1098
01:13:19,020 --> 01:13:20,397
You're not one of them.

1099
01:13:23,441 --> 01:13:24,943
You don't know me.

1100
01:13:26,319 --> 01:13:28,780
You have no idea who I am.

1101
01:13:30,907 --> 01:13:33,159
I don't even know who I am!

1102
01:13:34,452 --> 01:13:36,746
You are Carol Danvers.

1103
01:13:37,998 --> 01:13:40,125
You are the woman
on that black box

1104
01:13:40,208 --> 01:13:42,752
risking her life
to do the right thing.

1105
01:13:44,546 --> 01:13:46,298
My best friend...

1106
01:13:46,464 --> 01:13:49,384
who supported me
as a mother and a pilot

1107
01:13:49,467 --> 01:13:50,927
when no one else did.

1108
01:13:51,553 --> 01:13:56,641
You are smart, and funny,
and a huge pain in the ass...

1109
01:13:56,808 --> 01:14:00,061
and you were the most
powerful person I knew...

1110
01:14:00,228 --> 01:14:03,315
way before you could
shoot fire from your fists.

1111
01:14:04,065 --> 01:14:05,483
You hear me?

1112
01:14:06,901 --> 01:14:08,695
Do you hear me?

1113
01:14:15,952 --> 01:14:17,954
Come here. Come here, girl.

1114
01:14:18,622 --> 01:14:20,040
I got you.

1115
01:14:24,294 --> 01:14:27,297
TALOS: <i>I know
I don't deserve your trust...</i>

1116
01:14:27,547 --> 01:14:29,674
but you were our only lead.

1117
01:14:29,841 --> 01:14:32,093
We discovered
that your energy signature

1118
01:14:32,177 --> 01:14:34,929
matched Mar-Vell's core.

1119
01:14:35,764 --> 01:14:37,599
Now we know why.

1120
01:14:39,434 --> 01:14:43,396
If only you knew
the importance of it to me.

1121
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:46,232
I just need your help

1122
01:14:46,316 --> 01:14:49,861
decoding the coordinates
to Mar-Vell's lab.

1123
01:14:50,570 --> 01:14:53,615
Those weren't coordinates.
They're state vectors.

1124
01:14:53,782 --> 01:14:55,700
For orbital position
and velocity.

1125
01:14:55,867 --> 01:14:57,577
You didn't find her lab
on Earth,

1126
01:14:57,661 --> 01:14:58,912
'cause it's not on Earth.

1127
01:14:59,079 --> 01:15:00,163
VERS: That was the location

1128
01:15:00,246 --> 01:15:01,331
on the date
of the crash six years ago.

1129
01:15:01,498 --> 01:15:02,874
If we track its course,

1130
01:15:02,957 --> 01:15:05,251
we'll find it in orbit
right now.

1131

Glad to have you back, sir.

So, is it true?

1619
01:51:22,426 --> 01:51:23,636
That the Kree
burned your eye out...

1620
01:51:23,845 --> 01:51:26,222
because you refused
to give them the Tesseract?

I will neither confirm nor
deny the facts of that story.

I'm sorry to report

that we still haven't
found the Tesseract.
