00:42:09,536 --> 00:42:11,003
Yeah, right.

00:42:30,989 --> 00:42:32,215
ARTHUR: What is this?

487
00:42:32,257 --> 00:42:34,651
MERA: Customs
and border control.

488
00:42:34,693 --> 00:42:37,696
Don't worry.
I have diplomatic clearance.

489
00:42:45,571 --> 00:42:46,572
Welcome home.

490
00:43:35,220 --> 00:43:37,447
There's a safe house
down in the Old City.

491
00:43:37,489 --> 00:43:40,717
The Highborns never venture
to the sea floor.

492
00:43:40,759 --> 00:43:41,760
We're here.

493
00:44:11,023 --> 00:44:12,649
What is this?

494
00:44:12,691 --> 00:44:14,985
We use this air pocket as an
extra layer of precaution.

495
00:44:15,027 --> 00:44:17,554
Only the Highborns can
breathe water as well as air.

it keeps the animals out.

497
00:44:20,231 --> 00:44:22,300
They get kind of messy.

498
00:44:24,903 --> 00:44:26,763
Vulko. Here I am, old man.

499
00:44:26,805 --> 00:44:29,841
After all these years,
you finally get what you wanted.

500
00:44:32,476 --> 00:44:36,272
Arthur, I wish it was
under better circumstances.

501
00:44:36,314 --> 00:44:38,607
I can't believe Orm attacked.

502
00:44:38,649 --> 00:44:39,542
It wasn't an attack.

503
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:41,878
Legally,
he's not allowed to yet.

504
00:44:41,920 --> 00:44:45,314
What he did to your surface
warships was merely a warning.

505
00:44:45,356 --> 00:44:46,850
What provoked it?

506
00:44:46,892 --> 00:44:50,486
King Orm and your father
were ambushed by the surface.

507
00:44:50,528 --> 00:44:53,122
By the surface?
I don't think so.

508
00:44:53,164 --> 00:44:55,057
They still think
Atlantis is a fairy tale.

509
00:44:55,099 --> 00:44:56,759
I was there.

510
00:44:56,801 --> 00:44:58,628
A surface warship fired at us.

511
00:44:58,670 --> 00:45:01,364
Now, Xebel sides
with Atlantis,

512
00:45:01,406 --> 00:45:06,269
giving Orm a fleet big enough to force
the other two kingdoms to join him.

513
00:45:06,311 --> 00:45:10,840
If we're going to prevent this
war, you must dethrone him now.

514
00:45:10,882 --> 00:45:14,109
How many times do I have to tell you?
I don't wanna be king.

515
00:45:14,151 --> 00:45:15,879
You don't understand.

516
00:45:15,921 --> 00:45:18,381
Once he is named Ocean Master,
it'll be too late.

517
00:45:18,423 --> 00:45:22,117
The power at his disposal will be
unlike anything you have ever seen.

518
00:45:22,159 --> 00:45:24,788
I'm from the surface.
No one is gonna take me seriously.

519
00:45:24,830 --> 00:45:26,355
Okay? I don't even know
where to begin.

520
00:45:26,397 --> 00:45:28,825
By winning the hearts
and minds of the people

521
00:45:28,867 --> 00:45:33,605
by proving to them that you're
worthy, and retrieving this.

522
00:45:38,509 --> 00:45:39,577
Hmm.

523
00:45:40,311 --> 00:45:41,913
I already got one of those.

524
00:45:43,147 --> 00:45:45,374
Not like this one, you don't.

525
00:45:45,416 --> 00:45:48,044
This is
the Lost Trident of Atlan.

526
00:45:48,086 --> 00:45:49,278
Oh, I know the story.

527
00:45:49,320 --> 00:45:52,781
It's more than a story.
It's real.

528
00:45:52,823 --> 00:45:57,820
<i>It was forged by the greatest
weapon masters in history.</i>

529
00:45:57,862 --> 00:46:01,632
<i>Crafted from Poseidon's steel
for King Atlan,</i>

530

<i>the first ruler of Atlantis.</i>

531
00:46:05,636 --> 00:46:09,874
<i>Legend says the trident was imbued
with the power to command the sea.</i>

532
00:46:11,242 --> 00:46:12,235
So what happened to it?

533
00:46:12,377 --> 00:46:16,639
To know that is to go back to
the time before the Great Fall,

534
00:46:16,681 --> 00:46:20,876
<i>when King Atlan
ruled over all that was,</i>

were one.</i>

<i>It was a time of great prosperity

<i>still thought the earth
was flat.</i>

00:46:41,204 --> 00:46:44,365
<i>But we became too ambitious,</i>

541
00:46:44,407 --> 00:46:47,036
<i>too hungry for power.</i>

One of our archeological teams

It's an ancient recording dating
back to the First Dynasty.

of the Sacred Trident.

We don't know.
The technology's too old.

559
00:47:55,345 --> 00:47:59,074
The cylinder bears the markings
of the Deserter Kingdom.

You must take it there

Why can't I use a sword?

646
00:55:10,911 --> 00:55:14,640
That's your mother's trident.
A traditional weapon of royalty.

647
00:55:14,682 --> 00:55:18,243
You'll never be a king
until you've mastered it.

648
00:55:18,285 --> 00:55:19,912
Why has she never
come to see me, huh?

649
00:55:19,954 --> 00:55:22,047
I told you,
when you're ready...

650
00:55:22,089 --> 00:55:26,151
Stop lying to me!
I've done everything you ever asked.

651
00:55:26,193 --> 00:55:28,986

you make up another one.

Does she not love me?

654
00:55:37,238 --> 00:55:40,432
Your mother loved you more
than anything in the world.

655
00:55:40,474 --> 00:55:44,268
But she had to return to
Atlantis to keep you safe.

656
00:55:44,310 --> 00:55:47,639
Her marriage to King Orvax
was arranged a long time ago,

657
00:55:47,681 --> 00:55:49,340
so she had to marry him...

658
00:55:49,382 --> 00:55:52,810
And bear him a son,
Prince Orm.

659
00:55:52,852 --> 00:55:55,146
When Orvax eventually
found out about you,

660
00:55:55,188 --> 00:55:57,715
he became overwhelmed
with jealousy

661
00:55:57,757 --> 00:56:02,428
and sacrificed her to the
creatures of the Trench.

662
00:56:05,164 --> 00:56:07,767
Are you saying
they executed her?

663
00:56:08,968 --> 00:56:10,270

670
00:56:41,066 --> 00:56:44,570
Do you think she would have enjoyed
watching her sons murder each other?

671
00:56:46,138 --> 00:56:50,635

and your reluctance, Mera.

672

when we were children.

But she's not here, is she?

679
00:57:05,625 --> 00:57:08,328

was treason.

Don't follow in her wake.

Let's go, Lady Mera.

686
00:57:45,732 --> 00:57:49,727
Down here, we have a legend
about the Karathen,

687
00:57:49,769 --> 00:57:54,632
an ancient sea monster so powerful
that even King Atlan himself feared it.

688
00:57:54,674 --> 00:57:59,035
So, he imprisoned it
in the depths of the ocean.

689
00:57:59,077 --> 00:58:03,741
And in that abyss, the creature
bides its time waiting to rise again.

690
00:58:03,783 --> 00:58:07,377
Atlantis has been
lying in wait...

And now,
the beast has awakened.

692
00:58:15,627 --> 00:58:21,266
You know, there was a time when I wanted
to meet you more than anything.

693
00:58:22,367 --> 00:58:24,527
Get to know my little brother.

694

that we were in it together.

If only I had known what a
dick you would turn out to be.

696
00:58:37,449 --> 00:58:41,378
You were the reason
our mother was executed.

697
00:58:41,420 --> 00:58:44,021
And I've hated you
for it ever since.

698
00:58:46,291 --> 00:58:49,952

Did you steal a boat?

1124
01:35:35,416 --> 01:35:38,511
Are the boats at the marina
not for public use?

1125
01:35:38,553 --> 01:35:41,682
No, those belong to people.

Orm's elite commandos.

01:35:47,029 --> 01:35:50,289
But the one who led them,
he wasn't Atlantean.

1130
01:35:50,331 --> 01:35:52,658
I've never seen him before.

1131

Yeah, I have.

1132
01:35:54,369 --> 01:35:56,871
He and his father
were pirates.

1133
01:35:58,339 --> 01:36:00,866
And he blames me
for his father's death.

1134
01:36:00,908 --> 01:36:05,480
They picked a dangerous line of trade.
It's not your fault.

That's not how it feels.

1136
01:36:10,284 --> 01:36:13,213
It was up to me,
and I let him die.

1137
01:36:14,255 --> 01:36:16,115
I could've saved him,
but I didn't.

1138
01:36:17,157 --> 01:36:21,087
And now, I made an enemy,
and he could have hurt you.

And that would
have been my fault.

Well, he's behind us now.

It's what lies ahead
that should concern us.

1142

The charted path leads
to the Kingdom of the Trench.

1143
01:36:37,045 --> 01:36:39,479
Are those the same creatures
that killed my mother?

1144
01:36:40,114 --> 01:36:41,439
Yes.

1145
01:36:41,481 --> 01:36:43,541
She was taken there
and sacrificed to them.

1146
01:36:43,583 --> 01:36:45,711
It's become a place of death.

Turn back?

1151
01:36:58,733 --> 01:37:02,728
Look, I learned from a young
age not to show weakness.

1152
01:37:02,770 --> 01:37:05,966
Okay? I solve my problems
with my anger and my fists.

1153
01:37:06,008 --> 01:37:08,968
I'm a blunt instrument,
and I'm damn good at it.

1154
01:37:09,010 --> 01:37:13,439
But I've done nothing but get
my ass kicked this whole trip.

1155
01:37:13,481 --> 01:37:16,475
I'm no leader.
I'm not a king.

1156
01:37:16,517 --> 01:37:20,212
I do not work
or play well with others.

1157
01:37:20,254 --> 01:37:24,917
And I can't let you die trying to
turn me into something that I'm not.

1158
01:37:24,959 --> 01:37:29,622
You think you're unworthy to lead
because you're of two different worlds.

1159
01:37:29,664 --> 01:37:32,758
But that is exactly
why you are worthy.

1160
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:35,536
You are the bridge
between land and sea.

1161
01:37:36,336 --> 01:37:37,972
I can see that now.

Have you any advice for me
as this war begins?

I have already
given it, My King.

But I will stand
by your decision, as always.

My decision.

1172
01:38:28,421 --> 01:38:29,823
To protect it.

While you betray it.

You think I do not know
of your treachery?

1175
01:38:38,297 --> 01:38:43,561
That you have remained loyal
to my mother's bastard son.

1176
01:38:43,603 --> 01:38:49,042
That you have spent years training
him to take the throne from me.

1177
01:38:52,045 --> 01:38:53,713
Do not deny it.

1178
01:38:56,851 --> 01:38:57,985
I do not.

01:38:58,585 --> 01:38:59,854

I have devoted my life
to Atlantis.

1182
01:39:07,261 --> 01:39:10,722
He wanted nothing to do with it.
You swore to serve the throne!

the king you'll ever be.
