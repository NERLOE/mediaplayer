1
00:02:16,178 --> 00:02:17,634
Relax.

2
00:02:18,096 --> 00:02:19,928
Anything in here
would be dead by now.

3
00:02:40,994 --> 00:02:42,985
There she is,

4
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,946
the Indominus Rex.

5
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:28,789
Specimen collected.
Sent to the surface.

6
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,990
Roger that.

7
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:32,409
Air One, clear for takeoff.
Begin tracking.

8
00:03:32,587 --> 00:03:33,748
- Copy that.
- Go, go!

9
00:03:33,922 --> 00:03:35,037
Tracking on.

10
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,643
Land One, the asset is secure.
We got what we came for.

11
00:03:49,855 --> 00:03:51,641
We're coming back for you.
Close the doors.

12
00:03:52,274 --> 00:03:54,561
Marine One, I gotta close
the gates. Get out of there.

13
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,983
Understood.
We're heading out.

14
00:04:17,215 --> 00:04:19,126
Marine One, I need to close the gates.
Confirm position.

15
00:04:19,634 --> 00:04:20,840
Can you hear me?
Are you out?

16
00:04:21,052 --> 00:04:22,338
Marine One?

17
00:04:24,014 --> 00:04:25,880
- Guys?
- What is that?

18
00:04:30,061 --> 00:04:31,802
Marine One,
I'm closing the gates.

19
00:04:36,985 --> 00:04:38,976
Seriously, guys,
I'm kind of exposed out here.

20
00:04:39,154 --> 00:04:42,442
Marine One-
Confirm you're out, Marine One.

21
00:04:42,532 --> 00:04:44,944
Confirm position.
Can you hear me, Marine One, where are you?

22
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,573
Come on!

23
00:04:49,748 --> 00:04:51,455
I can't reach them!

24
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:53,161
- Come on!
- What?

25
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:56,911
Behind you!

26
00:04:57,088 --> 00:05:00,251
What is going on?
I can't hear you!

27
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:15,558
No, no! Wait!
Don't go! No!

28
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,100
Throw him the ladder.

29
00:05:20,195 --> 00:05:21,731
Come on!
Bring it down!

30
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,612
Slow down! No, no, no!

31
00:05:25,951 --> 00:05:27,533
Don't go!

32
00:05:32,791 --> 00:05:33,781
Oh, God!

33
00:05:36,294 --> 00:05:38,535
No, wait! No, no! No!

34
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:46,714
Oh, God, no!

35
00:05:48,515 --> 00:05:49,505
God, no!

36
00:05:52,269 --> 00:05:53,600
We're gonna stall!

37
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,885
Cut it now!

38
00:05:55,063 --> 00:05:56,974
- Give him a chance!
- We're gonna die here!

39
00:05:57,148 --> 00:05:58,388
Come on! Come on!

40
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:00,023
No, no, no!

41
00:06:00,193 --> 00:06:01,524
Oh, God!

42
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:03,936
I said cut it!

43
00:06:04,114 --> 00:06:06,321
Don't do it! It's horrible!

44
00:06:06,491 --> 00:06:08,107
I don't wanna die!

45
00:06:11,288 --> 00:06:13,279
Yeah!

46
00:06:17,210 --> 00:06:19,201
- Yeah!
- Come on!

47
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:44,814
DNA sample secured.
Tell the boss we're coming back home.

48
00:07:14,851 --> 00:07:17,138
Three years after
the fall of Jurassic World,

49
00:07:17,228 --> 00:07:19,720
the debate
over Isla Nublar rages on.

50
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:23,936
The island's long-dormant
volcano, reclassified as active,

51
00:07:24,152 --> 00:07:26,894
has shown considerable unrest
in recent months.

52
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,939
Geologists now predict
an extinction-level event

53
00:07:30,158 --> 00:07:33,276
will kill off the last
living dinosaurs on the planet.

54
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:36,491
Since the disaster
that shocked the world in 2015,

55
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,290
the Masrani Corporation has paid out
more than 800 million in damages

56
00:07:40,502 --> 00:07:43,494
to settle class-action lawsuits
brought by survivors.

57
00:07:43,922 --> 00:07:46,459
Activist groups have mobilized
around the globe

58
00:07:46,716 --> 00:07:50,425
in what has become
the flashpoint animal rights issue of our time.

59
00:07:51,012 --> 00:07:53,219
With an eruption expected
at any moment,

60
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:56,010
the US Senate has convened
a special committee

61
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:58,050
to answer a grave,
moral question.

62
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:02,896
Do dinosaurs deserve
the same protections given to other endangered species

63
00:08:03,066 --> 00:08:05,228
or should they be left to die?

64
00:08:05,944 --> 00:08:09,482
I think that we should allow

65
00:08:10,365 --> 00:08:12,356
our magnificent
and glorious dinosaurs

66
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:15,196
to be taken out by the volcano.

67
00:08:16,538 --> 00:08:17,994
Murderer.

68
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:19,617
Silence, please.

69
00:08:19,749 --> 00:08:21,615
As deeply sad as that would be,

70
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:25,119
we altered the course
of natural history.

71
00:08:26,756 --> 00:08:27,791
This is a correction.

72
00:08:27,924 --> 00:08:32,009
Are you suggesting the Almighty is taking
matters in his own hands?

73
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:35,929
Senator, with all due respect,
God's not part of the equation, no.

74
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:38,132
What I mean is that,
in the last century,

75
00:08:38,226 --> 00:08:41,810
we amassed landmark
technological power

76
00:08:42,313 --> 00:08:46,056
and we've consistently proven ourselves
incapable of handling that power.

77
00:08:46,735 --> 00:08:49,523
Eighty years ago, who could've
predicted nuclear proliferation?

78
00:08:49,654 --> 00:08:51,736
But then there it was.
And now we've got genetic power,

79
00:08:51,906 --> 00:08:55,274
so how long is it gonna take for
that to spread around the globe

80
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:57,568
and what's gonna be
done with it?

81
00:08:58,955 --> 00:09:01,162
It ain't gonna stop with the
de-extinction of the dinosaurs.

82
00:09:02,417 --> 00:09:04,124
I'm not sure I know
what you're talking about.

83
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,794
I'm talking about man-made,

84
00:09:08,131 --> 00:09:10,839
cataclysmic change.

85
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:12,795
What kind of change?

86
00:09:14,054 --> 00:09:15,636
Change is like death.

87
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:20,386
You don't know what it looks like
until you're standing at the gates.

88
00:09:36,451 --> 00:09:37,612
Yes, absolutely!

89
00:09:40,121 --> 00:09:41,953
We would love to have a
photo op with the senator.

90
00:09:42,123 --> 00:09:44,740
As a matter of fact, I do have the
dinosaurs' best interests in mind.

91
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:45,999
I'm a paleo-veterinarian.

92
00:09:46,169 --> 00:09:47,330
Is that a real thing?

93
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:48,539
That's a real thing.

94
00:09:48,963 --> 00:09:50,545
No, I haven't seen one
with my own eyes.

95
00:09:50,632 --> 00:09:52,873
You know, not everyone can afford
to spend their life savings...

96
00:09:53,468 --> 00:09:54,503
Claire!

97
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,006
Oh, uh...

98
00:09:57,097 --> 00:09:58,508
Hello. Hello, um...

99
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,214
Congresswoman Delgado.

100
00:10:00,433 --> 00:10:01,468
Congresswoman Delgado.

101
00:10:01,643 --> 00:10:03,475
I'm Claire. I'm the lead
organizer here.

102
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:06,223
Of course, but if I could just
get a moment of your time?

103
00:10:08,108 --> 00:10:10,190
Great. Thank you. Um...

104
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:12,943
So, our mission here at the
Dinosaur Protection Group

105
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:16,071
is to secure federal funding
for a safe, natural...

106
00:10:16,241 --> 00:10:17,823
That was, like, 40 seconds.
You're getting better.

107
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:19,825
You gotta stop letting
your mom shop for you.

108
00:10:19,994 --> 00:10:22,782
You don't need to insult me every
time someone pisses you off.

109
00:10:22,997 --> 00:10:25,204
Dude, I'm a doctor,
not a telemarketer.

110
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:26,706
What is your job again?

111
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,204
You plug in cords, right?

112
00:10:28,378 --> 00:10:30,119
It's actually more important
than it sounds.

113
00:10:30,713 --> 00:10:32,545
- Can I ask you a question?
- Go on.

114
00:10:32,715 --> 00:10:34,297
- Do you have kids?
- girls.

115
00:10:34,467 --> 00:10:36,003
Okay. So, your kids,

116
00:10:36,177 --> 00:10:38,293
an entire generation,
has grown up in a world

117
00:10:38,471 --> 00:10:40,929
where dinosaurs
are living and breathing.

118
00:10:41,516 --> 00:10:43,928
But soon, they're gonna have
to watch them go extinct.

119
00:10:44,394 --> 00:10:45,475
Or not.

120
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:48,053
If people like you
make a difference.

121
00:10:48,857 --> 00:10:51,098
Set up a meeting with my
office after the hearing.

122
00:10:51,401 --> 00:10:52,482
Great.

123
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:54,643
Yes!

124
00:10:55,864 --> 00:10:57,480
We now go live to the Capitol...

125
00:10:57,657 --> 00:11:00,274
- Claire, it's on.
- Turn it up.

126
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:02,234
...the US government
will take preventative action

127
00:11:02,328 --> 00:11:04,865
to protect the dinosaurs
on Isla Nublar.

128
00:11:05,039 --> 00:11:06,746
After thorough deliberations,

129
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:10,451
the committee has resolved not to
recommend any legislative action

130
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,996
<i>regarding the de-extinct
creatures on Isla Nublar.</i>

131
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:16,123
This is an act of God.

132
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:19,505
And while, of course, we feel
great sympathy for these animals,

133
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,966
we cannot condone
government involvement

134
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,223
on what amounts to
a privately-owned venture.

135
00:11:29,397 --> 00:11:31,764
They're all gonna die
and no one cares.

136
00:11:33,443 --> 00:11:34,433
We do.

137
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:42,069
Give me one second.
Let's get back to work.

138
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,071
Okay, everyone, come on.

139
00:11:47,999 --> 00:11:49,034
Hello?

140
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,456
May I speak with Ms. Dearing?

141
00:11:50,752 --> 00:11:51,992
Yes, this is Claire Dearing.

142
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:54,703
Good morning, I'm calling from Mr.
Benjamin Lockwood's estate.

143
00:11:54,881 --> 00:11:56,713
Would you mind holding
for a second?

144
00:11:56,883 --> 00:11:58,965
Yes, of course I'll hold.

145
00:12:26,704 --> 00:12:28,069
Ms. Dearing, you're early.

146
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:30,113
Would you like to step in?

147
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:31,531
Thank you.

148
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:35,497
I will inform Mr. Mills
that you've arrived.

149
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:01,646
John Alfred Hammond,
the father of Jurassic Park.

150
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:03,313
But of course you knew that.

151
00:13:03,491 --> 00:13:07,075
Hello, Claire. I'm Eli Mills.
I work for Ben Lockwood.

152
00:13:07,328 --> 00:13:09,239
We actually met once,
seven, eight years ago,

153
00:13:09,330 --> 00:13:11,492
- and you don't remember.
- Of course I remember.

154
00:13:11,624 --> 00:13:13,661
- Haven't you run his foundation since...
- Since college, yeah.

155
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,287
- You remember?
- Yes.

156
00:13:15,503 --> 00:13:16,834
Wow. Cool.

157
00:13:16,921 --> 00:13:19,959
He wanted someone young and
idealistic to spend his fortune

158
00:13:21,175 --> 00:13:22,381
and I used to be both.

159
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,176
Follow me.

160
00:13:26,723 --> 00:13:28,634
Let me give you
a bit of history.

161
00:13:28,975 --> 00:13:30,215
This is where it all began.

162
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:33,476
Before the island,
Sorna, Jurassic Park, all of it.

163
00:13:33,646 --> 00:13:37,014
Hammond and Lockwood built a
custom lab in the sub-basement,

164
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:40,900
extracted the first DNA from
amber right beneath our feet.

165
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:42,777
Oh, my goodness.

166
00:13:43,239 --> 00:13:45,025
What they did here
was a miracle.

167
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:47,278
I still believe that.

168
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:48,942
So do I, Claire.

169
00:13:49,370 --> 00:13:50,360
So do I.

170
00:13:50,455 --> 00:13:53,789
And I still believe it matters
what happens to those animals.

171
00:13:54,250 --> 00:13:58,164
There is something Mr. Lockwood would
very much like you to do, Claire.

172
00:13:58,338 --> 00:14:00,830
You can call it a favor
for an old friend.

173
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:04,341
We have a piece of land.

174
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:06,877
A sanctuary protected
by natural barriers,

175
00:14:07,513 --> 00:14:08,878
fully self-sustaining.

176
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:12,800
A new home where the dinosaurs
will be secure and free.

177
00:14:12,977 --> 00:14:14,058
You're gonna get them out?

178
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:15,765
You're gonna save them?

179
00:14:15,938 --> 00:14:17,474
No, Ms. Dearing.

180
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,522
I'm going to save us.

181
00:14:20,318 --> 00:14:22,855
We could both use a touch
of redemption, couldn't we?

182
00:14:23,946 --> 00:14:25,107
Lovely to see you again.

183
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,692
And you, Mr. Lockwood.

184
00:14:28,493 --> 00:14:30,985
This was all
John Hammond's dream.

185
00:14:31,162 --> 00:14:33,779
To let these creatures
live in peace.

186
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:37,574
So, we have created sanctuary.

187
00:14:37,794 --> 00:14:39,330
No fences. No cages.

188
00:14:40,088 --> 00:14:41,453
No tourists.

189
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:43,838
Just as Mother Nature intended.

190
00:14:44,384 --> 00:14:45,715
John said it best.

191
00:14:47,011 --> 00:14:49,503
"These creatures
don't need our protection.

192
00:14:50,223 --> 00:14:52,555
"They need our absence."

193
00:14:55,353 --> 00:14:58,436
When we were young,
we both shared this passion,

194
00:14:58,689 --> 00:15:00,020
John and I.

195
00:15:01,109 --> 00:15:02,645
What fools we were,

196
00:15:04,362 --> 00:15:07,605
trying to run before
we'd learned to walk.

197
00:15:07,782 --> 00:15:09,989
As all young men do, I suppose.

198
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,948
But we learned.

199
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:16,196
Unfortunately, in the end,

200
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,406
it drove us apart.

201
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:25,005
Life teaches us
some very hard lessons,

202
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,289
doesn't it, Claire?

203
00:15:28,386 --> 00:15:29,501
Yes.

204
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:31,586
- Hmm?
- Sir Benjamin.

205
00:15:31,931 --> 00:15:32,966
Ah.

206
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,388
My bloody medicines.

207
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:36,766
Will you excuse me, Claire?

208
00:15:36,853 --> 00:15:37,843
Of course.

209
00:15:38,146 --> 00:15:40,558
Eli here will
help you with the details.

210
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,223
We will save them.

211
00:15:44,944 --> 00:15:46,309
What a gift

212
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:49,521
for our children.

213
00:15:50,450 --> 00:15:51,440
Thank you.

214
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:54,158
Iris?

215
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:01,286
Does he have children? I thought I saw...
Was there a little girl?

216
00:16:01,461 --> 00:16:02,747
He has a grandchild.

217
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:05,457
His daughter died
in a car accident.

218
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:06,830
That's awful.

219
00:16:06,924 --> 00:16:09,666
Yeah, I know, but they're very close.
Really close.

220
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:13,011
So, what do you need from me?

221
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:15,968
There was a tracking
system in place at your park.

222
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,099
Radio-frequency ID chips
in each dinosaur.

223
00:16:18,311 --> 00:16:19,301
- I remember.
- Right.

224
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,095
So, if we could
access that system,

225
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:24,014
our ability to locate and
capture those animals safely

226
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,565
would increase tenfold.

227
00:16:25,735 --> 00:16:28,147
We need your handprint
to access the system,

228
00:16:28,488 --> 00:16:30,104
but what I really need, Claire,

229
00:16:31,824 --> 00:16:32,814
is you.

230
00:16:33,326 --> 00:16:35,658
Moving endangered species
isn't exactly legal,

231
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:37,284
but it's the right thing to do.

232
00:16:37,497 --> 00:16:38,953
No one knows this park
as well as you do

233
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:40,326
and we need that expertise.

234
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:44,034
- How many can you save?
- Eleven species. For sure.

235
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:47,379
I mean, more if we can,
but time is against us.

236
00:16:47,507 --> 00:16:51,216
I'm afraid there is
one animal in particular

237
00:16:51,802 --> 00:16:53,759
that poses a real challenge
for us.

238
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:56,592
- Blue.
- I didn't know she had a name,

239
00:16:56,766 --> 00:16:58,348
but Blue is potentially

240
00:16:58,434 --> 00:17:00,721
the second-most intelligent
piece of life on this planet

241
00:17:00,895 --> 00:17:03,432
and she's the last of her kind.
She must be preserved.

242
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:06,689
She can pick up your scent a mile off.
You'll never capture her.

243
00:17:07,401 --> 00:17:11,736
Well, we thought you might
know someone who could help.

244
00:17:12,782 --> 00:17:14,864
Maybe you could convince him.

245
00:17:35,680 --> 00:17:40,265
Oh, Time, she is
a freight train chugging

246
00:17:41,561 --> 00:17:44,804
Oh, stalling Time is, too

247
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:48,807
When the light
at the end of the tunnel

248
00:17:51,571 --> 00:17:55,109
Is growing small behind you

249
00:17:55,199 --> 00:17:56,189
Hey, Owen.

250
00:17:57,410 --> 00:18:00,619
I still love you in the morning

251
00:18:00,705 --> 00:18:01,695
Owen!

252
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,076
Oh, boy.

253
00:18:11,382 --> 00:18:12,463
Hi.

254
00:18:13,884 --> 00:18:15,340
Back for more, huh?

255
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:17,753
Can I buy you a beer?

256
00:18:18,598 --> 00:18:20,930
Did you bring them, or do we
gotta, like, go somewhere?

257
00:18:28,774 --> 00:18:30,139
I'm sorry.

258
00:18:30,318 --> 00:18:31,399
Seriously?

259
00:18:31,569 --> 00:18:33,480
I can't believe you think
that you left me!

260
00:18:33,738 --> 00:18:35,604
Replay the conversation
in your head, all right?

261
00:18:35,740 --> 00:18:38,482
You said, "You wanna go live
in your van, like a bum?

262
00:18:38,743 --> 00:18:40,233
"Go ahead, Owen."

263
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:41,822
And I said, "Okay."

264
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,324
So, how is that you leaving me?

265
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:45,329
Because I left. I left you.

266
00:18:45,499 --> 00:18:48,036
You left because I told you to.

267
00:18:48,252 --> 00:18:49,913
And then, I left.

268
00:18:50,379 --> 00:18:52,461
Because you didn't wanna live in
a van on the side of the road.

269
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,872
- No. No, no, no.
- Remember?

270
00:18:53,966 --> 00:18:56,754
Because you wouldn't let me drive
the damn van for five minutes.

271
00:18:56,927 --> 00:18:58,417
I'm chivalrous.
What can I do?

272
00:18:58,596 --> 00:18:59,927
You are so stubborn.

273
00:19:00,139 --> 00:19:02,050
Well, look at you now.
You're saving the world.

274
00:19:02,224 --> 00:19:03,259
I'm trying, at least.

275
00:19:03,351 --> 00:19:05,433
You can't just run away
from everything, Owen.

276
00:19:05,603 --> 00:19:06,718
So, you're what...

277
00:19:06,979 --> 00:19:08,344
Dating an accountant now?

278
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,517
An insurance actuary?

279
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:12,766
Your skin looks nice.

280
00:19:15,529 --> 00:19:16,519
Dermatologist?

281
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:17,987
Owen...

282
00:19:18,115 --> 00:19:19,446
- Does he check you for moles?
- Stop.

283
00:19:19,617 --> 00:19:20,607
A ventriloquist?

284
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:22,275
This is not
why we're here, okay?

285
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:23,951
Yeah, I know why we're here.

286
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:26,366
Lockwood's little
flunky called me.

287
00:19:27,208 --> 00:19:28,243
Rescue op.

288
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,209
Save the dinosaurs from an
island that's about to explode.

289
00:19:31,420 --> 00:19:33,081
- What could go wrong?
- I'm going.

290
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:34,962
- Don't.
- I don't have a choice.

291
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:36,418
What? Of course
you have a choice.

292
00:19:36,592 --> 00:19:38,708
So, what, I should just
build my own cabin,

293
00:19:38,803 --> 00:19:40,510
play pool, and drink beer
all day

294
00:19:40,596 --> 00:19:42,507
while these dinosaurs
go extinct?

295
00:19:42,682 --> 00:19:44,673
Yeah. I like pool.

296
00:19:45,810 --> 00:19:46,925
Blue is alive.

297
00:19:48,896 --> 00:19:49,886
Jesus, Claire!

298
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:51,353
You raised her, Owen.

299
00:19:51,857 --> 00:19:54,189
You spent years of your life
working with her.

300
00:19:54,944 --> 00:19:56,685
You're just gonna let her die?

301
00:19:58,781 --> 00:19:59,771
Well, yeah.

302
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,365
Come on, you're a better man
than you think you are.

303
00:20:08,332 --> 00:20:10,289
You should write
fortune cookies.

304
00:20:12,461 --> 00:20:13,667
Forget it...

305
00:20:14,171 --> 00:20:16,208
There's a charter flight
leaving tomorrow morning.

306
00:20:16,674 --> 00:20:19,041
You're on the manifest.
I just wanted to let you know.

307
00:20:35,568 --> 00:20:37,605
All right, chow time, chow time.

308
00:20:38,154 --> 00:20:39,315
Whoa, whoa.

309
00:20:39,447 --> 00:20:40,903
Back up. Back off.

310
00:20:41,073 --> 00:20:43,235
Hey, hey, hey. Jeez.

311
00:20:43,451 --> 00:20:45,692
Take it easy. Echo.

312
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,611
Jeez, there's plenty of food.

313
00:20:49,665 --> 00:20:51,497
God, you guys been
eating sugar or something?

314
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:52,748
You're hyper today.

315
00:20:54,754 --> 00:20:57,166
Okay, okay. Back up.

316
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,088
Thank you, Blue.

317
00:21:01,177 --> 00:21:02,508
Whoa, whoa.

318
00:21:07,892 --> 00:21:08,882
Did you get that?

319
00:21:18,110 --> 00:21:21,648
Relax. You're more likely to die
riding on a horse than in a plane.

320
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:23,654
No, I'm not, because
I won't get on a horse.

321
00:21:23,741 --> 00:21:24,731
My chances are zero.

322
00:21:24,867 --> 00:21:26,198
Planes are
the safest way to travel.

323
00:21:26,368 --> 00:21:29,360
You call this a plane? My
cousin has a drone bigger than this.

324
00:21:36,796 --> 00:21:38,628
Owen!

325
00:21:38,964 --> 00:21:40,705
Franklin, you wiener,
get on the plane.

326
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,423
Didn't think you were
gonna ever show up.

327
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:44,045
Oh, um...

328
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:45,672
This is Zia Rodriguez.

329
00:21:45,763 --> 00:21:46,594
Zia.

330
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:48,258
- Hey, how you doing?
- Yeah, real good. How are you?

331
00:21:48,349 --> 00:21:49,339
Good.

332
00:21:49,433 --> 00:21:51,595
Franklin Webb.
Systems analyst.

333
00:21:53,896 --> 00:21:55,307
Nervous flyer?

334
00:21:55,523 --> 00:21:57,560
Would you ride a thousand-pound horse
that's been abused all its life?

335
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,191
I rode my motorcycle through the
jungle with a pack of raptors.

336
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:03,606
We're not compatible.

337
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:17,784
Maisie?

338
00:22:19,672 --> 00:22:22,881
You're always hiding from me.
This is not my job, looking for you.

339
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:25,625
Maisie!

340
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,545
Maisie!

341
00:22:32,226 --> 00:22:33,466
Come out!

342
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:48,277
Boo!

343
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:49,607
You silly sausage.

344
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:50,817
You'll be the death of me.

345
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:53,160
You know, one day,
my heart might really stop.

346
00:22:53,622 --> 00:22:54,828
Then what would you do?

347
00:22:55,082 --> 00:22:56,618
Go and live in the forest
with the lions?

348
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:57,995
There are no lions
in the forest.

349
00:22:58,085 --> 00:22:59,291
Your grandfather's
been asking for you.

350
00:22:59,461 --> 00:23:00,451
- Really?
- Mmm.

351
00:23:00,546 --> 00:23:02,708
So, you go see your grandfather, and
then you go straight to your bath.

352
00:23:02,882 --> 00:23:04,623
- I don't want a bath.
- What?

353
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:05,923
Queen's English, girl.

354
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:07,171
- Bath.
- Bath.

355
00:23:07,261 --> 00:23:08,092
- Bath.
- Bath.

356
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:10,427
Bath, not "bath,"
you're not a wild animal.

357
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:12,596
Stop.

358
00:23:17,771 --> 00:23:18,761
Hi, Grandpa.

359
00:23:18,856 --> 00:23:20,346
Ah, there you are.

360
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:22,398
Come over and sit by me.

361
00:23:22,568 --> 00:23:23,649
I've missed you.

362
00:23:23,736 --> 00:23:25,022
I was on safari

363
00:23:25,195 --> 00:23:27,311
all the way through the Cretaceous
to the Jurassic in one day.

364
00:23:27,615 --> 00:23:28,821
Oh, my. What'd you see?

365
00:23:28,908 --> 00:23:31,991
Mostly herbivores.
There was one T. Rex, though.

366
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:35,782
Casualties, of course.
Iris included.

367
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:37,531
She jumped out of her skin.

368
00:23:38,125 --> 00:23:40,162
You have your mother's wicked sense of humor.

369
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,830
Do I look like her?

370
00:23:47,134 --> 00:23:48,249
Oh, yes.

371
00:23:49,637 --> 00:23:51,878
You could be her mirror image.

372
00:23:53,223 --> 00:23:55,681
Did my mother
ever visit the park?

373
00:23:57,019 --> 00:23:59,351
Once, a long time ago.

374
00:24:00,689 --> 00:24:02,680
She would've saved them,
too, you know.

375
00:24:03,984 --> 00:24:06,100
She would have saved them all.

376
00:24:58,080 --> 00:25:00,538
That's two klicks past the LZ.

377
00:25:03,377 --> 00:25:04,367
Claire.

378
00:25:08,173 --> 00:25:10,005
Ken Wheatley. Welcome back.

379
00:25:10,134 --> 00:25:12,045
Quite an operation
you've got going on here.

380
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:15,174
Mr. Lockwood takes his humanitarian
efforts very seriously.

381
00:25:15,389 --> 00:25:17,676
Where's the, uh,
raptor wrangler?

382
00:25:18,726 --> 00:25:19,716
Animal behaviorist.

383
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,639
- Owen Grady.
- Hey, Owen. Ken Wheatley.

384
00:25:22,813 --> 00:25:24,929
And you are
the Great White Hunter?

385
00:25:26,442 --> 00:25:28,979
I guess. I'm the
expedition facilitator.

386
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:31,394
Oh, God! It's hot.

387
00:25:33,741 --> 00:25:35,527
It's about to get
a whole lot hotter.

388
00:25:40,622 --> 00:25:43,239
Keep it moving!
You're all clear!

389
00:25:43,834 --> 00:25:46,417
Go! Go! You've got
the green light!

390
00:25:47,421 --> 00:25:51,380
This way!
Let's go! Let's go! Keep it moving!

391
00:25:51,884 --> 00:25:53,875
Hold it! Hold up!

392
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:05,060
Need some bug spray?

393
00:26:05,355 --> 00:26:06,595
Bug spray?

394
00:26:09,234 --> 00:26:11,020
The T. Rex would be dead
by now, right?

395
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:13,311
No, it's impossible to know
the max lifespan of a clone

396
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,526
in a completely different
environment.

397
00:26:15,908 --> 00:26:17,819
Take a caveman that
would've lived 20 years.

398
00:26:17,993 --> 00:26:19,950
Feed him prime meals,
give him health care,

399
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,282
he's gonna live
five times as long.

400
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,539
So, she'd be dead by now? Right?

401
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:15,794
Bad memories?

402
00:27:18,178 --> 00:27:19,668
Some were good.

403
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:32,272
What was that?

404
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,023
Is it the T. Rex?

405
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,373
I have to see this.

406
00:27:51,295 --> 00:27:54,037
Hey! Miss? Miss!

407
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,839
This area is not secured.

408
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:29,705
Look at that.

409
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,582
Never thought
I'd see one in real life.

410
00:28:34,922 --> 00:28:36,504
She's beautiful.

411
00:28:48,185 --> 00:28:49,767
Can we...

412
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,698
Okay, let's go.

413
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,492
Okay. Okay.

414
00:29:10,916 --> 00:29:12,498
Okay, main system...

415
00:29:14,127 --> 00:29:15,117
And turn on the controls.

416
00:29:16,630 --> 00:29:18,086
It should be working.

417
00:29:25,681 --> 00:29:28,218
Come on, tiger. Do you know what you're doing?

418
00:29:33,355 --> 00:29:34,436
After you, tiger.

419
00:29:38,652 --> 00:29:41,235
Are we sure these biometric
chips are still transmitting?

420
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:42,903
Battery would be dead by now.

421
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:44,438
The dinosaur is the battery.

422
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:45,773
They're powered by
body heat and movement.

423
00:29:46,743 --> 00:29:48,199
Hand.

424
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:53,155
How much longer until...

425
00:29:56,336 --> 00:29:57,451
FRANKLIN; I'm in.

426
00:30:01,174 --> 00:30:02,790
There's a large concentration
on the east dock.

427
00:30:03,010 --> 00:30:05,468
That's our boat.
We've already captured a bunch of them.

428
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,093
Without the tracking system?

429
00:30:07,556 --> 00:30:09,342
The big herbivores
are easy to find.

430
00:30:09,516 --> 00:30:10,972
Can you isolate that raptor?

431
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:12,349
- I need a species code.
- D-9.

432
00:30:16,398 --> 00:30:17,604
There she is.

433
00:30:18,525 --> 00:30:19,936
I'm gonna need
to borrow your truck.

434
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,228
I'm coming with you.

435
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,061
We don't know what kind of
condition she might be in.

436
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,988
Miss, things could get
hairy out there.

437
00:30:29,036 --> 00:30:30,447
These are powerful sedatives.

438
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:32,987
One too many,
and she could have respiratory failure.

439
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:36,199
Also, I'm not as soft and witless
as your comment implies.

440
00:30:37,419 --> 00:30:38,909
Let's go, beefcake.

441
00:30:39,379 --> 00:30:40,369
Oh, Owen?

442
00:30:43,467 --> 00:30:44,923
Be careful, okay?

443
00:30:48,722 --> 00:30:50,087
If I don't make it back,

444
00:30:51,892 --> 00:30:54,975
remember, you're the one
who made me come.

445
00:30:57,439 --> 00:30:59,180
I'll be all right.

446
00:31:08,909 --> 00:31:11,617
We're not going to get any
closer to her in this thing.

447
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:14,703
- We should stop here.
- Hold up.

448
00:31:17,209 --> 00:31:19,075
Load out, look alive,
stay alive.

449
00:31:19,669 --> 00:31:21,034
- We got your back, brother.
- Yeah.

450
00:31:23,006 --> 00:31:24,496
Claire, I'm going to
have to track her alone.

451
00:31:24,674 --> 00:31:27,006
I'll need you to be my eyes
if she runs. Copy?

452
00:31:27,177 --> 00:31:28,417
Copy that.

453
00:32:03,672 --> 00:32:06,585
Wheatley, I'm on fresh sign.
Wait for my signal.

454
00:32:33,118 --> 00:32:34,654
There you are.

455
00:32:49,384 --> 00:32:50,670
Hey, girl, you miss me?

456
00:32:53,555 --> 00:32:54,545
Easy. Hey!

457
00:32:54,931 --> 00:32:56,888
Hey.

458
00:32:58,226 --> 00:32:59,716
I brought you something.

459
00:33:05,233 --> 00:33:06,223
Here you go.

460
00:33:07,611 --> 00:33:08,817
That's right.

461
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:13,071
Okay.

462
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:15,858
Hey!

463
00:33:19,998 --> 00:33:21,033
You know me.

464
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,452
Eyes on me.

465
00:33:25,212 --> 00:33:26,293
Yeah.

466
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:29,246
Yeah. Yeah.

467
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,166
You know me.

468
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,335
That's right.

469
00:33:35,347 --> 00:33:36,758
That's right.

470
00:33:38,934 --> 00:33:39,924
Hold your...

471
00:33:42,437 --> 00:33:43,518
I told you to wait
for my signal.

472
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:51,148
Back your men up right now.

473
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:03,956
No, wait! No, no!
No, don't shoot her!

474
00:34:12,259 --> 00:34:14,170
Wheatley, you son of a bitch!

475
00:34:23,103 --> 00:34:24,264
Owen!

476
00:34:24,479 --> 00:34:25,765
What are you doing?

477
00:34:25,855 --> 00:34:26,845
Owen!

478
00:34:36,241 --> 00:34:37,356
You shoot me

479
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:39,407
and that animal dies.

480
00:34:39,828 --> 00:34:41,694
I think we have
the drop on you, sweetheart.

481
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:44,659
She's losing blood.
And if I don't treat her,

482
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:47,366
she'll never make it
back to camp.

483
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,005
How about this?

484
00:34:58,138 --> 00:35:00,675
That animal dies, I shoot you.

485
00:35:00,974 --> 00:35:02,556
You're gonna take care of her.

486
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,300
Let's move out!

487
00:35:18,450 --> 00:35:21,033
Cut the cord and let's go!
Let's get out of here!

488
00:35:26,082 --> 00:35:28,494
No, no, no! Wait!

489
00:35:32,547 --> 00:35:34,037
Wait, are they protecting us?
What's going on?

490
00:35:36,301 --> 00:35:37,336
I don't think so.

491
00:35:40,388 --> 00:35:41,674
Why am I here?

492
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,768
Hey, Mills, we got her done.
Mission accomplished.

493
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:53,857
Just in the nick of time.

494
00:35:54,069 --> 00:35:55,651
Wheatley, what the hell
is going on there?

495
00:35:55,737 --> 00:35:57,068
We're a day
behind schedule already.

496
00:35:57,238 --> 00:35:59,821
I want that money
in the bank by the time I get back, all right?

497
00:35:59,991 --> 00:36:02,608
Okay, good. Listen to me.
No more delays, okay?

498
00:36:02,786 --> 00:36:03,901
- If we don't get those animals...
- Mr. Mills?

499
00:36:04,079 --> 00:36:05,490
Not now, Maisie.
Thank you. If we don't get

500
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,904
- those animals...
- Mr. Mills, are the dinosaurs safe?

501
00:36:07,082 --> 00:36:08,743
I said not now!

502
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,496
Mills? Mills?

503
00:36:12,671 --> 00:36:14,878
I'm sorry, honey.
This is an important call.

504
00:36:15,090 --> 00:36:17,878
If you go up to the library, I'll
meet you up there in a few minutes.

505
00:36:17,967 --> 00:36:18,957
- Okay.
- Okay.

506
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,591
I'll tell you all about it,
I promise.

507
00:36:20,929 --> 00:36:22,465
- Okay.
- Okay.

508
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:28,308
Wheatley, you get
those animals here now!

509
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:30,602
I want that bonus.
We got the blue one.

510
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,600
Bring her to me first!

511
00:36:32,816 --> 00:36:33,977
All right.

512
00:37:49,601 --> 00:37:51,217
No!

513
00:38:09,621 --> 00:38:11,282
Hello, can anyone hear me?

514
00:38:11,706 --> 00:38:12,696
Hello?

515
00:38:12,999 --> 00:38:14,330
Hello, is anybody there?

516
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,749
Can anybody copy?

517
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,579
I'm... I'm trying everything.
It's jammed.

518
00:38:20,757 --> 00:38:22,464
"Just take the job, son,
build your people skills."

519
00:38:22,550 --> 00:38:23,585
Yeah, thanks, Dad.

520
00:38:25,678 --> 00:38:27,260
That's it.

521
00:38:29,682 --> 00:38:30,672
Proximity alert.

522
00:38:32,352 --> 00:38:33,717
Something's coming.

523
00:38:33,978 --> 00:38:35,093
Where does that tunnel lead?

524
00:38:36,231 --> 00:38:38,017
Well, it connects
to the rest of the...

525
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,435
Park.

526
00:38:44,197 --> 00:38:46,939
It's the T. Rex,
it's the T. Rex! Claire, it's the T. Rex.

527
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,364
It's the T. Rex,
it's the T. Rex.

528
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:49,782
Will you stop?
It's not the T. Rex!

529
00:38:50,578 --> 00:38:51,943
Probably.

530
00:38:52,664 --> 00:38:53,950
"Probably"?

531
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:59,288
Lava! Lava! Lava! Lava!

532
00:38:59,462 --> 00:39:00,918
Deep breaths, Franklin.

533
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,970
See? Not a T. Rex!

534
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,396
How is this better?

535
00:39:31,703 --> 00:39:34,411
Claire, what do we do?
What do we do?

536
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:37,951
It's stuck!

537
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,449
Chair!

538
00:39:55,310 --> 00:39:57,096
Come on! Let's go!

539
00:39:58,438 --> 00:39:59,519
Come on, Franklin!

540
00:40:01,024 --> 00:40:03,356
We made it! Yeah!

541
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:27,081
Come on, come on, come on!

542
00:40:29,677 --> 00:40:30,883
Yes, yes, go, go!

543
00:40:31,346 --> 00:40:32,336
Go, go!

544
00:40:44,067 --> 00:40:45,398
Claire!

545
00:40:46,986 --> 00:40:48,021
Holy...

546
00:40:59,958 --> 00:41:01,119
Run!

547
00:41:02,961 --> 00:41:04,326
Run!

548
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:07,503
Run!

549
00:41:17,517 --> 00:41:18,632
Run!

550
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:27,937
Oh, my God!

551
00:42:19,620 --> 00:42:21,031
Go! Go!

552
00:42:21,205 --> 00:42:22,536
- Okay.
- We're okay.

553
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:24,160
- Buckle up.
- It's okay.

554
00:42:25,168 --> 00:42:26,249
Get in!

555
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:46,738
Owen!

556
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,549
We gotta get out.

557
00:44:40,636 --> 00:44:42,968
We just fell
from the cliff. We're alive.

558
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:44,804
We're alive!

559
00:44:44,891 --> 00:44:46,347
Franklin, move!

560
00:44:47,018 --> 00:44:48,474
No, no, no!

561
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,354
No. Claire, we're gonna sink!
Water's leaking!

562
00:44:54,483 --> 00:44:57,851
Oh, God.
We need to get out!

563
00:45:00,865 --> 00:45:02,230
Franklin, watch out!

564
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:07,409
I wanna go home!

565
00:45:10,958 --> 00:45:12,949
Owen. Owen!

566
00:45:13,085 --> 00:45:14,291
Owen?

567
00:45:14,462 --> 00:45:15,793
Owen. Okay.

568
00:45:17,131 --> 00:45:18,747
Move! Move!

569
00:45:23,304 --> 00:45:24,840
No! No, no, no!

570
00:45:25,890 --> 00:45:27,051
Push!

571
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,597
Owen! No.

572
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,688
Where's he going?

573
00:45:36,192 --> 00:45:37,398
Okay,
don't panic. Don't panic.

574
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,980
We're running out of air.
We're not gonna make it.

575
00:45:40,154 --> 00:45:42,566
We are. We are.
Take a deep breath.

576
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:54,801
Where is Zia?

577
00:46:54,937 --> 00:46:57,053
It was a double-cross.
They took her, she must be with Blue.

578
00:46:57,398 --> 00:46:59,184
Hey! Can you still track them?

579
00:47:01,569 --> 00:47:02,730
Not anymore.

580
00:47:04,488 --> 00:47:05,569
It was a lie.

581
00:47:05,740 --> 00:47:07,572
It was a lie. Bastards!

582
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:09,111
It was all a lie!

583
00:47:23,632 --> 00:47:24,918
Not all of it.

584
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:37,518
Let's move it!
Move! Move!

585
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,264
Anything of value,
I want on that boat!

586
00:47:40,441 --> 00:47:42,398
- How you doing?
- The bolt won't give!

587
00:47:42,568 --> 00:47:45,481
Just button it up,
and we'll tow it on! Let's go!

588
00:47:46,906 --> 00:47:48,692
Lock it up! Move it out!

589
00:47:51,410 --> 00:47:53,526
Come on, now.

590
00:48:07,760 --> 00:48:10,593
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
Hang on! Wait up!

591
00:48:10,971 --> 00:48:13,087
Stop that truck! Stop it!

592
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:19,306
Hey, sweetheart.
Hello, hello.

593
00:48:27,613 --> 00:48:29,024
Beautiful.

594
00:48:29,323 --> 00:48:31,405
You're gonna feel that
when you wake up.

595
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:34,942
Hey, put your weapon down!

596
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:36,948
You got the barrel pointed
right at her head!

597
00:48:39,875 --> 00:48:41,240
They have Zia.
They're loading out.

598
00:48:41,460 --> 00:48:43,576
If they already had the dinosaurs,
why did they need us?

599
00:48:44,463 --> 00:48:46,830
They needed the tracking
system to capture Blue.

600
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:49,044
There she is.
She don't look good.

601
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:55,379
We need to get on that boat.

602
00:48:55,558 --> 00:48:57,174
The rock's good.
We're safe on the rock.

603
00:48:57,268 --> 00:48:58,884
It's the boat
or the lava, Franklin.

604
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,185
All right, boat's good.
I'm all about the boat.

605
00:49:03,941 --> 00:49:05,602
Go, go, get on the boat!

606
00:49:05,776 --> 00:49:07,983
Get on the boat, now! Go, go!

607
00:49:10,364 --> 00:49:12,526
- Move it, move it!
- Go, go, go!

608
00:49:15,578 --> 00:49:16,659
Get that truck!

609
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,550
- Franklin!
- Hey, get that truck going!

610
00:49:36,640 --> 00:49:37,675
Okay.

611
00:49:38,517 --> 00:49:39,882
- You okay?
- Am I dead?

612
00:49:40,019 --> 00:49:41,225
Not yet, kid.

613
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,441
Come on!

614
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,154
Come on. Give me
your hand! Reach!

615
00:49:57,369 --> 00:49:58,609
Come on, reach!

616
00:50:10,591 --> 00:50:11,626
Hold on!

617
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:16,998
Mr. Mills?

618
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:19,296
Your visitor's waiting.

619
00:52:24,141 --> 00:52:25,131
Mr. Eversoll.

620
00:52:26,018 --> 00:52:28,510
It's a pleasure to meet you in person after all this time.
How are you?

621
00:52:28,729 --> 00:52:29,719
- Excuse me.
- Yeah?

622
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:32,472
Where are the dinosaurs?
The dinosaurs are, uh, are en route.

623
00:52:33,192 --> 00:52:35,354
Oh, so, am I supposed
to sell these ones?

624
00:52:35,527 --> 00:52:37,393
You don't need to worry, okay?
They will be here soon.

625
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:40,233
I don't really work
with amateurs,

626
00:52:40,324 --> 00:52:42,565
so I'm gonna contact my buyers
and call this off.

627
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,155
They will be here tomorrow,
and your buyers won't be disappointed.

628
00:52:45,287 --> 00:52:46,652
Trust me, whatever their interest,

629
00:52:46,747 --> 00:52:48,829
agricultural, industrial,
sport hunting,

630
00:52:48,999 --> 00:52:50,535
we will have something
to suit them.

631
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:51,949
Eleven species,

632
00:52:52,127 --> 00:52:55,165
each with unique
biopharmaceutical properties.

633
00:52:55,339 --> 00:52:57,501
I estimate four million
per species.

634
00:52:58,258 --> 00:53:01,376
Four million is a slow
Tuesday where I'm from.

635
00:53:02,513 --> 00:53:03,628
You're wasting my time.

636
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:05,304
You ever made 100 million
on a Tuesday?

637
00:53:05,391 --> 00:53:06,927
Huh?

638
00:53:08,686 --> 00:53:10,176
All this is in the past.

639
00:53:11,563 --> 00:53:13,349
I wanna talk to you
about the future.

640
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,849
I'll give you 10 minutes.

641
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,813
The whole point of selling
the Isla Nublar dinosaurs

642
00:53:21,907 --> 00:53:24,148
is to finance our future
operations here.

643
00:53:24,326 --> 00:53:26,488
It's, uh, seed money.

644
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:29,745
Call it an overture
to something much more ambitious.

645
00:53:29,832 --> 00:53:32,199
Yeah, and more
lucrative, I guess.

646
00:53:32,376 --> 00:53:35,243
Right, we've reactivated
the old facilities,

647
00:53:35,462 --> 00:53:36,668
updated the technology,

648
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:39,338
and imported the best geneticists
from around the world.

649
00:53:39,550 --> 00:53:41,507
This operation has been
many years in the planning.

650
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:44,006
Genetic power is
an uncharted frontier.

651
00:53:44,930 --> 00:53:48,048
The potential for growth
is more than you can fathom.

652
00:53:50,769 --> 00:53:51,884
This way, please.

653
00:53:52,354 --> 00:53:54,391
If the entire run
of our sorry history

654
00:53:54,523 --> 00:53:56,810
has taught us
one irrevocable lesson,

655
00:53:56,900 --> 00:54:00,143
it's that man is inevitably
drawn to war

656
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:03,779
and is willing to use any
means necessary to win it.

657
00:54:04,450 --> 00:54:05,906
You're gonna weaponize them?

658
00:54:06,118 --> 00:54:07,984
We've been using animals
in combat for centuries.

659
00:54:08,162 --> 00:54:09,744
Horses, elephants.

660
00:54:09,955 --> 00:54:11,946
The Soviets used
disease-bearing rats

661
00:54:12,040 --> 00:54:13,246
against the Germans
at Stalingrad.

662
00:54:13,333 --> 00:54:14,323
Yes, yes.

663
00:54:14,543 --> 00:54:16,159
Our geneticists have created

664
00:54:16,295 --> 00:54:19,162
a direct descendant
of Henry Wu's masterpiece,

665
00:54:19,339 --> 00:54:21,171
the animal that took down
Jurassic World.

666
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:23,920
Indominus Rex.

667
00:54:24,178 --> 00:54:27,261
Her DNA, retrieved from the island
way before its destruction,

668
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:31,675
forms the architecture
of a completely new creature.

669
00:54:31,852 --> 00:54:35,186
Every bone and muscle designed
for hunting and killing.

670
00:54:35,397 --> 00:54:37,764
And thanks
to Owen Grady's research,

671
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:40,182
it follows human command.

672
00:54:40,652 --> 00:54:43,861
We call it the lndoraptor.

673
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,031
Grandpa?

674
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:54,238
Grandpa?

675
00:55:12,100 --> 00:55:14,432
Grandpa.

676
00:55:14,978 --> 00:55:17,015
Maisie, what are you doing up?

677
00:55:17,105 --> 00:55:20,018
There was a man here
today with Mr. Mills.

678
00:55:20,234 --> 00:55:23,397
It was probably just some business
about the sanctuary. That's all.

679
00:55:23,570 --> 00:55:24,731
I heard them talking.

680
00:55:24,905 --> 00:55:26,111
They're going to sell
the dinosaurs.

681
00:55:26,615 --> 00:55:28,777
- They're bringing them here.
- Oh. Huh.

682
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,107
I'm sure you misunderstood.

683
00:55:30,202 --> 00:55:31,488
I know what I heard, Grandpa.

684
00:55:31,578 --> 00:55:34,036
Maisie, it's way past
your bedtime.

685
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:36,322
Let's talk about this
in the morning.

686
00:55:36,625 --> 00:55:37,831
- But...
- Maisie,

687
00:55:38,126 --> 00:55:39,457
I'll find out tomorrow.

688
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,035
Go to bed.

689
00:55:43,048 --> 00:55:44,038
Good night.

690
00:55:44,132 --> 00:55:45,622
Good night, my heart.

691
00:56:14,997 --> 00:56:16,704
Jesus.

692
00:56:24,590 --> 00:56:26,001
It's okay, Blue,
just a little longer.

693
00:56:27,384 --> 00:56:28,624
Oh, my God!
You guys are alive!

694
00:56:33,891 --> 00:56:35,302
Oh, look what
they've done to her.

695
00:56:35,809 --> 00:56:36,844
Who are these assholes?

696
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,801
Animal traffickers.
Look how they're treating them.

697
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:41,144
They're not gonna take them to a sanctuary,
they're gonna sell them.

698
00:56:41,315 --> 00:56:42,976
Not Blue, they need her
for something else.

699
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:44,231
Like what?

700
00:56:44,318 --> 00:56:45,479
I don't know, but she's...

701
00:56:45,694 --> 00:56:47,480
She's hemorrhaging,
and I don't have instruments

702
00:56:47,613 --> 00:56:48,774
and they want to keep her alive.

703
00:56:48,989 --> 00:56:49,979
Hey.

704
00:56:51,867 --> 00:56:53,449
- You're all right, you're all right.
- Claire, come here.

705
00:56:53,702 --> 00:56:55,113
Come on.
Put your hand here.

706
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:56,235
Steady pressure.

707
00:56:56,371 --> 00:56:57,861
Hey, hey, hey.

708
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:00,740
Watch out.

709
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:03,826
I can't take the bullet out without
a transfusion from another animal.

710
00:57:04,046 --> 00:57:05,457
Which one of you knows
how to find a vein?

711
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:07,713
Oh! I did a blood drive
for the Red Cross.

712
00:57:08,258 --> 00:57:09,999
Great. Okay.

713
00:57:10,719 --> 00:57:12,505
Franklin, take over for Claire.

714
00:57:12,679 --> 00:57:13,760
No, no, no.

715
00:57:13,972 --> 00:57:15,508
Franklin, now!

716
00:57:17,726 --> 00:57:19,808
Steady pressure.

717
00:57:19,895 --> 00:57:22,387
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

718
00:57:22,606 --> 00:57:23,596
Is it in my mouth?

719
00:57:23,774 --> 00:57:25,060
- Did it get in my mouth?
- Mmm-mmm.

720
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,439
- You sure?
- You're good.

721
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:27,642
I can feel it on my face.

722
00:57:27,736 --> 00:57:28,851
All of the animals
should be sedated.

723
00:57:29,029 --> 00:57:30,190
Look for any kind of Tetanuran,

724
00:57:30,364 --> 00:57:32,105
their blood type
should be close enough.

725
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:35,365
Look for carnivores with two or three fingers.
No more than three.

726
00:57:37,496 --> 00:57:39,407
I think there's one on board.

727
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:55,711
You gotta be kidding me.

728
00:58:12,698 --> 00:58:13,813
She's tranqued.

729
00:58:19,413 --> 00:58:21,780
Okay, okay. Okay,
I got it. Come on.

730
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:24,365
Okay.

731
00:58:28,255 --> 00:58:30,872
Oh, no. Are you okay?

732
00:58:32,092 --> 00:58:33,082
I'm okay.

733
00:58:33,760 --> 00:58:35,125
Come on.

734
00:58:40,684 --> 00:58:42,174
- You're gonna have to do it.
- I can't.

735
00:58:42,394 --> 00:58:43,429
The skin is too thick.

736
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,181
I have to use both my hands
to put pressure on the vein.

737
00:58:45,564 --> 00:58:46,554
You gotta do it.

738
00:58:46,690 --> 00:58:48,101
I... I can't...
I can't reach.

739
00:58:48,275 --> 00:58:50,391
You're gonna have to
climb up there.

740
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:52,609
Oh, I'm not...

741
00:58:52,696 --> 00:58:53,811
No, no. I'm not gonna
climb up there.

742
00:58:54,031 --> 00:58:55,567
You'll be okay.
It's like riding a bull.

743
00:58:55,699 --> 00:58:57,736
"Riding a bull"?
I didn't grow up at a rodeo

744
00:58:57,951 --> 00:58:59,612
- or wherever you came from.
- She's asleep now.

745
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,869
I can't say that she's gonna
be asleep a minute from now, so get up.

746
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:03,946
Okay, fine.

747
00:59:04,124 --> 00:59:06,456
Oh, my God, she stinks.

748
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,830
Gently. Gently.

749
00:59:08,920 --> 00:59:10,285
No, no, no.

750
00:59:20,348 --> 00:59:21,338
Good job.

751
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,133
You're making this
look totally normal.

752
00:59:26,605 --> 00:59:29,472
You're gonna have to jam it in there,
it's really thick skin.

753
00:59:30,275 --> 00:59:31,310
- Ready?
- Yeah.

754
00:59:31,526 --> 00:59:33,688
- Okay. One, two...
- One, two...

755
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:35,815
Stab!

756
00:59:36,490 --> 00:59:37,480
Owen!

757
00:59:46,541 --> 00:59:47,531
It's working.

758
00:59:51,129 --> 00:59:52,210
The pee is silent.

759
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:53,628
That door is open.

760
00:59:53,799 --> 00:59:54,789
I got it.

761
01:00:13,110 --> 01:00:14,976
The bars!
The bars, Owen.

762
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,311
Owen, I can get
through there. Come on.

763
01:00:30,794 --> 01:00:32,000
Jump, Owen!

764
01:00:38,593 --> 01:00:40,880
Owen, jump. Now!

765
01:00:50,689 --> 01:00:51,895
Did you see that?

766
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,639
Uh-huh.

767
01:00:54,276 --> 01:00:55,812
Please tell me
you got the blood.

768
01:02:20,570 --> 01:02:22,777
This is Delta.
She's one of the hold over theropods,

769
01:02:22,864 --> 01:02:24,070
one of the survivors
from the second group.

770
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:26,315
Now, watch this.

771
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:29,076
I show any sign of weakness
whatsoever...

772
01:02:35,335 --> 01:02:36,541
See that?

773
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:40,417
Day 176. Blue is showing
unprecedented levels of compliance.

774
01:02:41,091 --> 01:02:42,331
Here I am with Blue.

775
01:02:43,885 --> 01:02:45,626
She's a theropod
from the new group.

776
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:49,004
I show signs of weakness...

777
01:03:02,904 --> 01:03:03,894
Hey.

778
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:06,605
I'm okay.

779
01:03:09,077 --> 01:03:10,238
She's pretty extraordinary.

780
01:03:22,215 --> 01:03:24,172
Blue, displaying levels

781
01:03:24,384 --> 01:03:27,172
of interest, concern,

782
01:03:27,387 --> 01:03:28,843
hyper-intelligence,

783
01:03:29,431 --> 01:03:30,887
cognitive bonding.

784
01:03:31,057 --> 01:03:32,138
See that?

785
01:03:33,601 --> 01:03:36,013
She's tilting her head,
she's craning forward.

786
01:03:37,022 --> 01:03:39,263
Increased eye movement.
She's curious.

787
01:03:39,858 --> 01:03:41,314
She's showing empathy.

788
01:03:42,485 --> 01:03:45,898
Okay, I'm gonna make an incision
in her leg to remove the bullet.

789
01:03:50,201 --> 01:03:52,067
It's a lot of muscle tissue.

790
01:04:24,986 --> 01:04:25,976
She's gonna be okay.

791
01:04:32,827 --> 01:04:33,817
Blue is the key.

792
01:04:36,122 --> 01:04:38,329
That's it. You have Blue,

793
01:04:38,833 --> 01:04:40,540
you get these raptors to do anything.

794
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:41,791
You're sure she'll live?

795
01:04:41,961 --> 01:04:43,292
If it dies, we have
blood samples.

796
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:44,916
No, no, no.
That's not good enough.

797
01:04:45,131 --> 01:04:48,214
The raptor is a behavioral specimen.
We need her in good health.

798
01:04:48,385 --> 01:04:52,219
I didn't shoot the damn thing.
What do you want me to do, huh?

799
01:04:52,972 --> 01:04:57,432
You don't have the faintest
comprehension of what I'm doing here.

800
01:04:57,894 --> 01:05:02,104
Do you understand the complexity of
creating an entirely new life form?

801
01:05:02,232 --> 01:05:05,145
No, but I understand the
complexity of paying for it, okay?

802
01:05:05,568 --> 01:05:09,061
All your money will have been wasted if
I don't get Blue here in good health.

803
01:05:09,447 --> 01:05:11,905
To get the next iteration
under control,

804
01:05:12,033 --> 01:05:15,526
it needs to form a familial bond
with a closely related genetic link.

805
01:05:15,703 --> 01:05:17,865
- English, Henry.
- It needs a mother!

806
01:05:20,208 --> 01:05:24,167
Blue's DNA will be part of the
next lndoraptor's makeup.

807
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:27,417
So, it will be genetically coded
to recognize her authority

808
01:05:27,590 --> 01:05:28,705
and assume her traits.

809
01:05:28,883 --> 01:05:30,044
Empathy. Obedience.

810
01:05:30,218 --> 01:05:32,505
Everything the prototype
you have now is missing.

811
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:34,586
Okay, so how long is this gonna take?

812
01:05:34,764 --> 01:05:37,051
It's not a sprint, Mr. Mills.
It's a marathon.

813
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,632
A marathon sounds expensive.

814
01:05:39,269 --> 01:05:42,261
Besides, time is running out,
and so is my patience, Henry.

815
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:43,679
You have to understand,

816
01:05:43,857 --> 01:05:45,564
this is all uncharted territory.

817
01:05:45,650 --> 01:05:46,936
A wolf, genetically,

818
01:05:47,152 --> 01:05:49,143
is barely distinguishable
from a bulldog,

819
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,937
but within that gray area

820
01:05:53,741 --> 01:05:54,947
is art.

821
01:05:55,118 --> 01:05:57,109
Spare me the poetry, Henry.

822
01:05:57,203 --> 01:05:59,160
Can you do it? Can you do it?

823
01:05:59,330 --> 01:06:00,491
Yes, I can do it.

824
01:06:01,291 --> 01:06:02,827
MILLS; Well, then do it.

825
01:06:03,001 --> 01:06:04,287
Thank you.

826
01:06:04,836 --> 01:06:06,452
God, you're a pain in the ass.

827
01:06:19,684 --> 01:06:21,675
Hey. Hey! Maisie!

828
01:06:24,689 --> 01:06:27,181
What is that? What is it?

829
01:06:34,824 --> 01:06:37,361
Keep her in there
and keep the door locked.

830
01:06:37,785 --> 01:06:38,991
You want to keep her locked in?

831
01:06:39,120 --> 01:06:40,451
That's exactly what I want.

832
01:06:40,622 --> 01:06:42,579
Sir Benjamin needs
to see you now.

833
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:47,746
I believe it's important.

834
01:07:18,535 --> 01:07:21,072
All crew, prepare for docking.

835
01:07:21,246 --> 01:07:22,987
All crew, prepare for docking.

836
01:07:23,164 --> 01:07:24,325
Let's move it, boys.

837
01:07:24,499 --> 01:07:26,991
Jeez! Will somebody shut that thing up?
It sounds like my ex-wife.

838
01:07:27,126 --> 01:07:28,366
We're here.

839
01:07:28,545 --> 01:07:29,535
Where?

840
01:07:29,629 --> 01:07:31,165
Just get in your truck and let's go.

841
01:07:31,506 --> 01:07:32,837
- Move. Move!
- Move, move, move!

842
01:07:34,008 --> 01:07:35,339
You got a heartbeat?

843
01:07:35,468 --> 01:07:36,924
Yeah. Do you?

844
01:07:37,136 --> 01:07:38,171
I need blood samples.

845
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,965
I'm not here to help you
reset the food chain,

846
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,172
so take your own damn samples.

847
01:07:46,104 --> 01:07:47,640
What a nasty woman.

848
01:07:47,855 --> 01:07:49,311
Go, go, now, now. Go.

849
01:07:50,316 --> 01:07:53,399
Attention, all crew.
Attention, all crew.

850
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:56,235
Drivers, get to your vehicles.

851
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,021
Hey!

852
01:07:59,158 --> 01:08:00,819
- What the hell is going on?
- I was...

853
01:08:02,078 --> 01:08:03,739
I needed an extra pair
of hands. He volunteered.

854
01:08:04,163 --> 01:08:05,870
- Are you deck crew?
- Aye, aye.

855
01:08:06,040 --> 01:08:07,496
We're loading out.
Follow me.

856
01:08:07,709 --> 01:08:09,291
Uh, does that mean we're
leaving the ship right now?

857
01:08:09,460 --> 01:08:11,952
That is what “loading out" means.
Now get moving. Come on, follow me.

858
01:08:12,964 --> 01:08:14,796
- Come on, kid. There's lots to do.
- Shit!

859
01:08:15,008 --> 01:08:17,045
- Oh, no. He's not gonna make it.
- Get a move on. Come on.

860
01:08:17,218 --> 01:08:19,425
- Move it! Come on. Move!
- We have to help him.

861
01:08:19,637 --> 01:08:20,968
Stay here, I'll get him.

862
01:08:22,682 --> 01:08:24,172
There's no time.
Let's go.

863
01:08:30,231 --> 01:08:31,517
I got five. I'm on it.

864
01:08:34,193 --> 01:08:35,683
Why is this truck still here?

865
01:08:38,948 --> 01:08:39,938
Good to go!

866
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:41,151
Roll out!

867
01:08:42,827 --> 01:08:43,908
Where are they taking them?

868
01:08:44,704 --> 01:08:46,320
- We're about to find out.
- Let's go!

869
01:08:47,915 --> 01:08:48,905
Ready to roll!

870
01:08:49,083 --> 01:08:50,244
Keep it coming!

871
01:08:52,879 --> 01:08:54,165
Move it out!
Keep it rolling!

872
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:57,964
Good to go!

873
01:08:58,176 --> 01:08:59,382
Come on, girl.

874
01:09:06,517 --> 01:09:07,552
Yes!

875
01:09:15,526 --> 01:09:17,392
This is Lockwood's estate.

876
01:09:19,113 --> 01:09:21,195
He must have one big-ass garage.

877
01:09:35,672 --> 01:09:38,255
Let's go! We want
this offloaded in 10 mikes!

878
01:09:39,092 --> 01:09:40,082
Big door's open.

879
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:10,320
Did you really think
you could get away with it?

880
01:10:11,624 --> 01:10:13,206
In my own house.

881
01:10:13,376 --> 01:10:14,912
You entrusted me

882
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:18,666
to guide your fortune
into the future.

883
01:10:19,340 --> 01:10:21,251
- I have done that.
- Damn you!

884
01:10:25,263 --> 01:10:26,503
Pick up that phone.

885
01:10:26,931 --> 01:10:29,923
I want you to call the police.

886
01:10:30,601 --> 01:10:33,059
It'll be easier
if the story comes from you.

887
01:10:35,606 --> 01:10:37,017
As you say, sir.

888
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,941
You know, I've been thinking,
John Hammond was right.

889
01:10:49,746 --> 01:10:52,784
It was an unholy thing
that you did.

890
01:10:56,002 --> 01:10:58,710
I'm not the only guilty one
here, am I, sir?

891
01:11:18,483 --> 01:11:19,473
Hey.

892
01:11:21,235 --> 01:11:23,852
We hit that town, we call the
cavalry, shut this down.

893
01:11:28,534 --> 01:11:30,070
Whoo. Hello.

894
01:11:30,870 --> 01:11:32,986
You should have stayed
on the island.

895
01:11:33,206 --> 01:11:34,241
Better odds.

896
01:11:45,843 --> 01:11:46,878
Hi, Claire.

897
01:11:48,763 --> 01:11:50,845
I just wanted to come
and apologize.

898
01:11:51,432 --> 01:11:53,173
I didn't wanna bring you
into any of this,

899
01:11:53,392 --> 01:11:55,303
but it was the only way
that we could get the raptor.

900
01:11:56,687 --> 01:11:57,927
We needed it.

901
01:11:58,272 --> 01:11:59,262
Come on.

902
01:12:00,942 --> 01:12:03,024
So, what? This is it?

903
01:12:03,986 --> 01:12:05,977
I mean, you're a smart guy,
you could have

904
01:12:06,113 --> 01:12:07,649
started a foundation,
cured cancer,

905
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:08,985
but instead you,

906
01:12:10,034 --> 01:12:11,024
what?

907
01:12:12,078 --> 01:12:13,239
Sell endangered species?

908
01:12:13,454 --> 01:12:14,660
I saved these animals.

909
01:12:14,872 --> 01:12:16,454
You betrayed a dying man
for money.

910
01:12:16,874 --> 01:12:19,036
Claire, I admire your idealism,

911
01:12:19,210 --> 01:12:20,826
but we both exploited
these animals.

912
01:12:20,962 --> 01:12:22,873
At least I have the integrity
to admit it.

913
01:12:23,089 --> 01:12:24,955
I never, ever did anything
remotely illegal.

914
01:12:25,049 --> 01:12:27,336
You authorized the creation
of the lndominus Rex.

915
01:12:28,511 --> 01:12:32,175
You exploited a living
thing in a cage for money.

916
01:12:32,306 --> 01:12:34,297
How is that different? Huh?

917
01:12:34,392 --> 01:12:37,930
And you, the man who proved
raptors can follow orders.

918
01:12:38,145 --> 01:12:40,728
You never thought about the
applications of your research, Owen?

919
01:12:40,940 --> 01:12:43,648
How many millions a trained
predator might be worth?

920
01:12:46,821 --> 01:12:47,856
You two,

921
01:12:48,614 --> 01:12:50,696
you're the parents
of the new world.

922
01:12:53,411 --> 01:12:55,152
Hey! Let him go.

923
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:57,491
- Owen.
- I think I'll break it.

924
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:58,868
Let him go.

925
01:13:02,962 --> 01:13:04,919
Claire, I just want...

926
01:13:13,014 --> 01:13:14,300
Say, how we gonna end this?

927
01:13:14,473 --> 01:13:18,888
Well, as far as everybody else is
concerned, they burned up on the island.

928
01:13:35,870 --> 01:13:38,703
Buyers on approach.
Looks like a full house.

929
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,405
Roger that.

930
01:14:07,652 --> 01:14:09,063
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

931
01:14:09,320 --> 01:14:10,435
- Welcome, gentlemen.
- Good evening.

932
01:14:10,613 --> 01:14:11,648
Welcome.

933
01:14:13,449 --> 01:14:17,033
And these guys are development
rep for Aldaris Pharmaceuticals.

934
01:14:17,119 --> 01:14:18,109
Great.

935
01:14:18,204 --> 01:14:20,866
The guy in the beard is a
proxy for Gregor Adlrich,

936
01:14:21,040 --> 01:14:22,622
a Slovenian arms dealer.

937
01:14:24,210 --> 01:14:26,076
Equine buyers.

938
01:14:26,253 --> 01:14:28,995
Rand Magnus, an oil magnate
from Houston.

939
01:14:29,173 --> 01:14:30,334
What's their interest?

940
01:14:30,508 --> 01:14:31,714
Strictly personal.

941
01:14:32,343 --> 01:14:35,335
His kid wants
a baby Triceratops.

942
01:14:36,222 --> 01:14:37,553
Glenn, how's Janet?

943
01:14:37,723 --> 01:14:39,213
She's doing fine, thanks.

944
01:14:39,308 --> 01:14:41,219
Straight ahead, Glenn.

945
01:14:57,952 --> 01:15:00,740
Well, he only wants
carnivores. Two of them.

946
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,788
Looks like Lookwood's gonna
have a very good night.

947
01:15:04,291 --> 01:15:05,452
Will he be joining us?

948
01:15:05,793 --> 01:15:07,704
Um...
That's very unlikely.

949
01:15:20,558 --> 01:15:21,548
Grandpa?

950
01:15:29,567 --> 01:15:30,557
Grandpa?

951
01:15:31,902 --> 01:15:33,233
Grandpa, wake up.

952
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:36,566
Grandpa!

953
01:15:38,492 --> 01:15:40,233
Grandpa, wake up. Wake up.

954
01:15:40,411 --> 01:15:42,527
Iris!

955
01:15:56,302 --> 01:15:57,383
Iris!

956
01:16:00,473 --> 01:16:01,679
It's over.

957
01:16:04,810 --> 01:16:05,800
What a tragedy.

958
01:16:10,775 --> 01:16:12,766
I suppose now he's gone,

959
01:16:13,235 --> 01:16:14,942
you'll be looking
for another situation.

960
01:16:15,112 --> 01:16:16,102
No.

961
01:16:17,448 --> 01:16:18,438
Maisie needs me.

962
01:16:20,910 --> 01:16:22,947
I'm her guardian now.

963
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:26,199
What she needs
is no longer your concern.

964
01:16:28,125 --> 01:16:30,617
You don't understand her
the way I do.

965
01:16:31,837 --> 01:16:33,419
I understand her value.

966
01:16:35,341 --> 01:16:36,877
But I raised her.

967
01:16:37,676 --> 01:16:40,008
I raised both of them.

968
01:16:44,725 --> 01:16:46,807
- Please, Mr. Mills.
- Goodbye, Iris.

969
01:17:27,059 --> 01:17:30,802
Do you remember the first time
you saw a dinosaur?

970
01:17:33,357 --> 01:17:35,849
First time you see them,
it's like

971
01:17:36,026 --> 01:17:37,141
a miracle.

972
01:17:37,862 --> 01:17:40,695
You read about them in books,
you see the bones in museums,

973
01:17:40,823 --> 01:17:43,406
but you don't really believe it.

974
01:17:43,576 --> 01:17:45,408
They're like myths.

975
01:17:46,078 --> 01:17:47,534
And then you see

976
01:17:48,956 --> 01:17:50,822
that first one alive.

977
01:17:56,046 --> 01:17:57,502
This is not your fault.

978
01:17:58,424 --> 01:17:59,414
But it is.

979
01:17:59,592 --> 01:18:00,832
No.

980
01:18:02,553 --> 01:18:04,043
This one's on me.

981
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,673
I showed them the way.

982
01:18:11,020 --> 01:18:12,055
Listen.

983
01:18:12,188 --> 01:18:15,476
You and I are gonna have plenty
of time to talk about this later.

984
01:18:15,566 --> 01:18:16,556
If there is a later.

985
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,437
Yes, there is.

986
01:18:20,821 --> 01:18:22,311
I got a cabin to finish.

987
01:18:31,040 --> 01:18:32,075
What is that?

988
01:18:36,754 --> 01:18:39,166
Well, look who just woke up.

989
01:18:40,716 --> 01:18:42,582
Go.

990
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:51,807
We're getting out of here.

991
01:18:53,479 --> 01:18:57,063
Welcome, ladies, gentlemen,

992
01:18:57,608 --> 01:19:00,976
to this extraordinary evening.

993
01:19:01,153 --> 01:19:02,814
Let's dive right in

994
01:19:02,988 --> 01:19:04,820
with lot number one,

995
01:19:06,200 --> 01:19:08,487
the Ankylosaurus.

996
01:19:10,120 --> 01:19:12,407
She's a herbivorous quadruped,

997
01:19:12,831 --> 01:19:14,538
late Cretaceous.

998
01:19:14,959 --> 01:19:18,418
This is one of the largest
armored dinosaurs,

999
01:19:19,380 --> 01:19:23,169
known by paleontologists
as a living tank.

1000
01:19:29,682 --> 01:19:31,013
What are you doing?

1001
01:19:31,183 --> 01:19:32,389
Escaping.

1002
01:19:32,559 --> 01:19:33,720
You sure about this?

1003
01:19:33,894 --> 01:19:34,929
Nope.

1004
01:19:37,022 --> 01:19:39,935
I have $4 million, anyone five?

1005
01:19:40,192 --> 01:19:41,774
- Five.
- $5 million.

1006
01:19:41,986 --> 01:19:43,397
$5 million. Do I hear six?

1007
01:19:43,612 --> 01:19:45,228
- $6 million.
- $6 million, thank you.

1008
01:19:45,447 --> 01:19:47,859
Any increase on six?
Seven. $7 million.

1009
01:19:48,075 --> 01:19:48,985
$8 million.

1010
01:19:49,076 --> 01:19:51,784
Nine million on the phones.
Do I hear 10 million?

1011
01:19:51,996 --> 01:19:53,452
- 10 million? 10 million.
- 10.

1012
01:19:53,664 --> 01:19:55,621
$10 million! Once, twice...

1013
01:19:56,542 --> 01:19:57,657
Sold!

1014
01:19:58,585 --> 01:20:00,997
To the gentleman from Indonesia.
Congratulations, sir.

1015
01:20:06,302 --> 01:20:09,169
Lot number two,
ladies and gentlemen.

1016
01:20:10,139 --> 01:20:12,301
A juvenile Allosaurus.

1017
01:20:13,809 --> 01:20:17,803
A fierce
and an aggressive predator.

1018
01:20:22,109 --> 01:20:23,270
Sold!

1019
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:24,357
Sold!

1020
01:20:25,863 --> 01:20:27,069
Sold.

1021
01:20:29,825 --> 01:20:30,815
Wonderful.

1022
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:33,568
Wonderful bidding.

1023
01:20:46,884 --> 01:20:48,875
Come on. You're good.
Let's go.

1024
01:20:49,386 --> 01:20:50,672
- Move it out.
- Here we go.

1025
01:20:50,763 --> 01:20:51,969
Bring it on back. Let's go.

1026
01:21:01,607 --> 01:21:02,597
Okay.

1027
01:21:03,484 --> 01:21:06,067
Hey! Hey, you.
Look at me! Look at me!

1028
01:21:07,112 --> 01:21:08,102
Hey!

1029
01:21:08,739 --> 01:21:10,229
Come with me.
Come with me!

1030
01:21:10,616 --> 01:21:11,981
Okay, there you go.

1031
01:21:30,135 --> 01:21:31,421
You're welcome.

1032
01:21:40,312 --> 01:21:41,768
Hey, wait!

1033
01:21:42,189 --> 01:21:43,475
Please, please wait.

1034
01:21:48,404 --> 01:21:50,111
That's Lockwood's granddaughter.

1035
01:21:51,990 --> 01:21:54,982
Hey. Hey, kid. You wanna
come down out of there?

1036
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:59,199
- Uh...
- Uh...

1037
01:22:00,374 --> 01:22:01,864
Do you remember me?

1038
01:22:03,877 --> 01:22:04,867
Yeah?

1039
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:07,916
My name is Claire.
What's yours?

1040
01:22:09,049 --> 01:22:10,210
Maisie.

1041
01:22:10,717 --> 01:22:11,752
Maisie Lockwood.

1042
01:22:11,927 --> 01:22:13,088
Maisie.

1043
01:22:13,262 --> 01:22:15,970
This is my friend, Owen.

1044
01:22:17,266 --> 01:22:18,381
I saw you

1045
01:22:18,559 --> 01:22:21,267
with the Velociraptors.
Blue.

1046
01:22:21,353 --> 01:22:22,843
Oh. Oh, yeah?

1047
01:22:23,897 --> 01:22:24,932
Uh...

1048
01:22:25,816 --> 01:22:27,557
You like dinosaurs?

1049
01:22:29,903 --> 01:22:30,893
So do I.

1050
01:22:31,071 --> 01:22:32,857
Tell you what,
you come on down from there,

1051
01:22:32,948 --> 01:22:34,780
I'll tell you everything
you need to know about Blue.

1052
01:22:35,826 --> 01:22:37,066
That sound all right?

1053
01:22:38,495 --> 01:22:39,781
All right, yeah.

1054
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:41,286
Come on down.

1055
01:22:50,048 --> 01:22:51,129
Sweetie,

1056
01:22:51,842 --> 01:22:53,833
we need some help
finding your grandfather.

1057
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:55,300
Can you take us to him?

1058
01:22:55,387 --> 01:22:57,424
No.

1059
01:22:58,056 --> 01:22:59,717
You made it down here
all by yourself, huh?

1060
01:23:00,100 --> 01:23:01,386
Brave kid.

1061
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:03,384
Looks like you could
use a friend.

1062
01:23:04,354 --> 01:23:05,344
He's gone.

1063
01:23:10,569 --> 01:23:12,025
Listen, I'll tell you what,

1064
01:23:12,196 --> 01:23:14,312
we were just about to go
and find our friends

1065
01:23:14,406 --> 01:23:15,942
and then get
the heck out of here.

1066
01:23:16,408 --> 01:23:17,898
You wanna come with us?

1067
01:23:18,327 --> 01:23:20,068
We could use a friend, too.

1068
01:23:22,206 --> 01:23:23,696
- 19.5!
- 19.5.

1069
01:23:23,874 --> 01:23:24,989
Do I hear 20?

1070
01:23:25,459 --> 01:23:28,042
Do I hear 20? 20? Thank you.
Thank you.

1071
01:23:28,212 --> 01:23:29,748
20. Do I hear...

1072
01:23:29,922 --> 01:23:32,505
$21 million!

1073
01:23:32,674 --> 01:23:34,711
21 million...

1074
01:23:35,052 --> 01:23:36,588
Sold!

1075
01:23:36,762 --> 01:23:38,344
And now, ladies and gentlemen,

1076
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:41,802
that we are halfway through
the evening...

1077
01:23:43,477 --> 01:23:46,811
...we 'd like to offer
a special treat to our

1078
01:23:47,439 --> 01:23:49,601
discriminating buyers.

1079
01:23:50,526 --> 01:23:52,267
This evening we will preview

1080
01:23:53,237 --> 01:23:56,320
a new asset that
we've been developing.

1081
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:58,898
A creature of the future

1082
01:23:59,076 --> 01:24:01,613
made from pieces of the past.

1083
01:24:03,747 --> 01:24:05,738
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be warned,

1084
01:24:06,583 --> 01:24:10,417
this is the perfect blend of the
two most dangerous creatures

1085
01:24:10,504 --> 01:24:12,791
that have ever walked the earth.

1086
01:24:13,882 --> 01:24:17,420
We call it the lndoraptor.

1087
01:24:39,908 --> 01:24:44,277
The perfect weapon for the modern age.
Built for combat.

1088
01:24:44,621 --> 01:24:48,706
With tactical responses more
acute than any human soldier.

1089
01:24:48,792 --> 01:24:50,203
What is that thing?

1090
01:25:06,977 --> 01:25:08,263
They made it.

1091
01:25:09,396 --> 01:25:10,886
Mr. Mills and the other man.

1092
01:25:11,106 --> 01:25:12,392
What man?

1093
01:25:13,650 --> 01:25:14,640
Him.

1094
01:25:14,735 --> 01:25:17,773
Designed
by Mr. Henry Wu

1095
01:25:17,904 --> 01:25:20,441
with an intelligence quotient
comparable to the Velociraptor.

1096
01:25:20,907 --> 01:25:24,195
Biospecs include
a heightened sense of smell

1097
01:25:24,286 --> 01:25:28,871
and trained to respond to a
pulse-coded laser targeting system,

1098
01:25:29,041 --> 01:25:31,874
enabling it to isolate
and track prey

1099
01:25:31,960 --> 01:25:35,078
in complex environments.
Voilà.

1100
01:25:41,803 --> 01:25:44,761
Now, first, the laser
sets the target.

1101
01:25:47,267 --> 01:25:48,723
Once locked on,

1102
01:25:49,436 --> 01:25:51,768
the acoustic signal
triggers the attack.

1103
01:25:58,987 --> 01:26:01,570
This animal is relentless.

1104
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:05,236
Now, modifications
are still being made...

1105
01:26:05,410 --> 01:26:06,571
20 million!

1106
01:26:10,207 --> 01:26:12,244
No, this is a prototype.

1107
01:26:12,417 --> 01:26:13,623
Uh, not for sale.

1108
01:26:13,960 --> 01:26:14,950
21!

1109
01:26:16,004 --> 01:26:19,372
- It is still a prototype, but...
- 22!

1110
01:26:20,676 --> 01:26:22,337
23!

1111
01:26:23,762 --> 01:26:25,127
24!

1112
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,139
$24 million.

1113
01:26:29,434 --> 01:26:31,175
25 million!

1114
01:26:31,978 --> 01:26:33,184
<i>Do I hear 26?</i>

1115
01:26:33,689 --> 01:26:35,396
That thing
can't leave this building.

1116
01:26:35,732 --> 01:26:36,938
26!

1117
01:26:37,192 --> 01:26:38,728
- Any advance on 26?
- 27!

1118
01:26:38,902 --> 01:26:40,142
$27 million from the back.

1119
01:26:40,320 --> 01:26:42,106
What are you doing?
This animal is not for sale.

1120
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,146
If you wanna create an addict,
you have to give them a taste.

1121
01:26:44,324 --> 01:26:45,359
He's a prototype.

1122
01:26:45,534 --> 01:26:50,449
This prototype is worth
$28 million right now.

1123
01:26:51,248 --> 01:26:53,205
Relax, we'll make some more.

1124
01:26:53,834 --> 01:26:55,120
So will they.

1125
01:27:17,190 --> 01:27:18,555
Hey, buddy.

1126
01:27:19,151 --> 01:27:20,357
You thinking what I'm thinking?

1127
01:27:23,029 --> 01:27:24,440
Once. Twice.

1128
01:27:25,115 --> 01:27:27,607
Sold to the Russian friend.

1129
01:27:28,869 --> 01:27:31,486
Well done, sir.
And congratulations...

1130
01:27:31,663 --> 01:27:33,745
...for this magnificent animal.

1131
01:28:30,639 --> 01:28:31,629
Oh, God!

1132
01:28:43,151 --> 01:28:44,141
Get this thing out of here!

1133
01:28:44,820 --> 01:28:46,026
Hey, you! Turn it out!

1134
01:29:36,997 --> 01:29:38,237
Mills!

1135
01:29:38,999 --> 01:29:40,615
Mills, where are you?

1136
01:29:41,543 --> 01:29:43,159
I want my bonus!

1137
01:29:49,968 --> 01:29:51,379
Holy cow!

1138
01:29:51,928 --> 01:29:53,293
What are you?

1139
01:29:54,306 --> 01:29:56,172
I didn't see you on the island.

1140
01:30:14,409 --> 01:30:15,774
Oh, you're a tough guy.

1141
01:30:49,319 --> 01:30:51,026
Look at you.

1142
01:30:52,864 --> 01:30:56,949
You're some kind of hot rod
with really pretty teeth.

1143
01:30:58,620 --> 01:31:01,738
This'll make a perfect
centerpiece for my necklace.

1144
01:31:20,892 --> 01:31:22,382
Open wide.

1145
01:31:46,960 --> 01:31:48,871
No. No.

1146
01:31:50,630 --> 01:31:51,961
Please.

1147
01:32:14,446 --> 01:32:15,481
Shh!

1148
01:32:16,489 --> 01:32:18,400
Move! Move!
Out of the way!

1149
01:33:03,828 --> 01:33:04,909
Don't!

1150
01:33:08,458 --> 01:33:10,324
You two, you deserve each other.

1151
01:33:11,127 --> 01:33:12,117
Maisie, come with me.

1152
01:33:12,837 --> 01:33:15,124
You got your money,
now walk away.

1153
01:33:15,507 --> 01:33:16,668
Oh, what are you gonna do, huh?

1154
01:33:16,758 --> 01:33:19,295
We're gonna stop this.
All of it.

1155
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:20,800
How?

1156
01:33:20,970 --> 01:33:23,302
What, are you gonna go back in time
before Hammond decided to play God?

1157
01:33:23,473 --> 01:33:24,508
You can't put it back
in the box!

1158
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:26,681
- We have to try.
- It's too late.

1159
01:33:26,768 --> 01:33:28,133
Maisie, come.

1160
01:33:30,563 --> 01:33:34,181
Oh! So, you're gonna
take care of her now?

1161
01:33:34,776 --> 01:33:35,766
Huh?

1162
01:33:36,361 --> 01:33:38,318
You have no idea what she is.

1163
01:33:39,489 --> 01:33:42,231
What do you think drove Hammond
and Lockwood apart, huh?

1164
01:33:42,909 --> 01:33:46,322
Lockwood never had a grandchild.

1165
01:33:47,080 --> 01:33:48,991
He just wanted
his daughter back.

1166
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,287
And he had the technology.

1167
01:33:54,587 --> 01:33:56,419
He created another.

1168
01:33:58,049 --> 01:33:59,539
He made her again.

1169
01:34:03,471 --> 01:34:04,461
Go.

1170
01:34:10,061 --> 01:34:12,143
Come on!

1171
01:34:13,106 --> 01:34:14,392
Come on.

1172
01:34:15,275 --> 01:34:17,516
Eggs need to go
in a sterile environment.

1173
01:34:19,237 --> 01:34:20,727
Where are those genome kits?

1174
01:34:27,495 --> 01:34:30,578
Get this to Mills.
Be very careful, it's extremely valuable.

1175
01:34:30,665 --> 01:34:32,576
You, I need blood samples
from the raptor.

1176
01:34:33,835 --> 01:34:35,246
Don't just stand there
like an idiot!

1177
01:34:35,336 --> 01:34:37,998
Get me 50 ccs carfentanil
and a phlebotomy kit!

1178
01:34:38,089 --> 01:34:39,830
It's right there! Now!

1179
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,382
Come on. Come on.

1180
01:34:43,469 --> 01:34:44,675
I need this raptor's blood.

1181
01:34:46,681 --> 01:34:48,297
Sure, go ahead.

1182
01:34:48,808 --> 01:34:50,549
Where is that kit?

1183
01:34:51,102 --> 01:34:52,592
Okay, now listen to me.

1184
01:34:52,896 --> 01:34:54,307
It is better for you
to cooperate.

1185
01:34:54,397 --> 01:34:55,387
I'm gonna get this blood

1186
01:34:55,732 --> 01:34:56,972
with or without your help.

1187
01:34:57,150 --> 01:34:58,481
This blood's contaminated.

1188
01:34:58,651 --> 01:35:01,188
I designed this animal myself.

1189
01:35:01,279 --> 01:35:02,269
It's pure.

1190
01:35:02,739 --> 01:35:06,152
Every cell of her body was created
in the most controlled environment

1191
01:35:06,284 --> 01:35:08,400
under the most demanding
of conditions.

1192
01:35:08,912 --> 01:35:11,870
Yeah, but I did an intravenous
blood transfusion with a T. Rex,

1193
01:35:11,956 --> 01:35:13,617
so, it's a sock drawer in there.

1194
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,331
You what?

1195
01:35:16,628 --> 01:35:18,289
Franklin! What are you doing?

1196
01:35:19,464 --> 01:35:21,000
Saving your life!

1197
01:35:25,136 --> 01:35:26,797
Yes!

1198
01:35:27,055 --> 01:35:28,261
Stop!

1199
01:35:30,099 --> 01:35:31,931
Don't move.

1200
01:35:36,606 --> 01:35:39,348
Now step away
from that cage. Now.

1201
01:35:48,117 --> 01:35:49,858
Easy now.

1202
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,602
Run. Run!

1203
01:38:19,811 --> 01:38:21,472
Dave, do you copy?
Dave, you there?

1204
01:38:21,813 --> 01:38:22,848
Run!

1205
01:39:47,773 --> 01:39:48,763
You see that?

1206
01:39:49,567 --> 01:39:51,023
That's hydrogen cyanide.

1207
01:39:51,194 --> 01:39:53,777
If it reaches the containment
level, it'll kill them all.

1208
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:57,272
The ventilation system is down.

1209
01:39:57,408 --> 01:39:58,523
Can you bring it back up?

1210
01:40:31,442 --> 01:40:33,683
The server's unresponsive.

1211
01:40:33,778 --> 01:40:34,984
I have to reboot
the whole system.

1212
01:40:35,071 --> 01:40:36,061
- So, reboot it.
- I'm trying.

1213
01:40:53,965 --> 01:40:55,046
What?

1214
01:40:57,134 --> 01:40:59,045
Franklin, we don't have time.
I know, I know, I know.

1215
01:41:00,471 --> 01:41:01,632
Okay.

1216
01:41:41,220 --> 01:41:42,335
Go. Go.

1217
01:41:42,513 --> 01:41:44,550
Run, run.

1218
01:42:39,320 --> 01:42:41,106
Hey. Here. You're okay.

1219
01:42:41,530 --> 01:42:42,861
Put pressure on it.
Don't look at it.

1220
01:42:43,074 --> 01:42:44,314
Look at me.
Look at me.

1221
01:42:44,492 --> 01:42:45,607
You have to go find her.

1222
01:42:45,743 --> 01:42:46,824
I can't leave you here.

1223
01:42:50,831 --> 01:42:53,368
Go. Go, I'll be fine.

1224
01:42:53,459 --> 01:42:54,449
Run!

1225
01:45:23,734 --> 01:45:25,270
Maisie, stay down!

1226
01:46:10,114 --> 01:46:11,320
Shh!

1227
01:46:30,175 --> 01:46:32,963
Follow me.
I know a way on the other side.

1228
01:46:36,098 --> 01:46:37,088
Come on.

1229
01:46:40,227 --> 01:46:41,467
Come on!

1230
01:46:58,245 --> 01:46:59,610
This way!

1231
01:47:32,571 --> 01:47:33,561
I got you.

1232
01:47:46,919 --> 01:47:47,909
Hey!

1233
01:48:17,408 --> 01:48:18,614
Come on.

1234
01:49:43,243 --> 01:49:44,654
What the hell?

1235
01:49:47,456 --> 01:49:48,537
Hey!

1236
01:49:50,834 --> 01:49:51,949
Hey!

1237
01:49:52,127 --> 01:49:53,117
You good?

1238
01:49:55,547 --> 01:49:56,878
Yeah. You?

1239
01:49:57,132 --> 01:49:58,122
Nope.

1240
01:49:58,634 --> 01:50:00,295
Hey, we got a problem
downstairs.

1241
01:50:00,385 --> 01:50:01,466
I need you to come see this.

1242
01:50:31,917 --> 01:50:33,248
They're all dying.

1243
01:50:33,418 --> 01:50:35,659
The blast damaged
the ventilation system.

1244
01:50:36,004 --> 01:50:37,870
We did everything we could.

1245
01:50:41,260 --> 01:50:42,671
I can open the gates from here.

1246
01:50:44,054 --> 01:50:45,670
Claire, be careful.

1247
01:50:47,349 --> 01:50:49,215
We're not on an island anymore.

1248
01:51:44,948 --> 01:51:45,983
Claire.

1249
01:51:46,408 --> 01:51:48,991
You press that button,
there is no going back.

1250
01:51:54,583 --> 01:51:56,073
We can't let them die.

1251
01:52:46,385 --> 01:52:47,921
I had to.

1252
01:52:49,054 --> 01:52:50,544
They're alive,

1253
01:52:51,056 --> 01:52:52,546
like me.

1254
01:53:24,548 --> 01:53:27,540
Don't! Don't!

1255
01:55:05,857 --> 01:55:07,188
Hey, girl.

1256
01:55:07,275 --> 01:55:08,265
Owen.

1257
01:55:08,360 --> 01:55:09,600
Shh!

1258
01:55:10,737 --> 01:55:12,398
It's okay, she won't hurt us.

1259
01:55:34,970 --> 01:55:35,960
Hey.

1260
01:55:44,438 --> 01:55:46,099
Blue, come with me.

1261
01:55:51,820 --> 01:55:53,982
We'll take you
to a safe place, okay?

1262
01:56:35,697 --> 01:56:37,608
How many times do you
have to see the evidence?

1263
01:56:38,617 --> 01:56:40,733
How many times
must the point be made?

1264
01:56:42,454 --> 01:56:44,286
We're causing
our own extinction.

1265
01:56:45,707 --> 01:56:47,243
Too many red lines
have been crossed.

1266
01:56:49,044 --> 01:56:52,708
And our home has, in fundamental
ways, been polluted

1267
01:56:52,923 --> 01:56:57,292
by avarice
and political megalomania.

1268
01:56:58,428 --> 01:57:00,760
Genetic power has
now been unleashed

1269
01:57:01,306 --> 01:57:03,547
and of course,
that's gonna be catastrophic.

1270
01:57:04,309 --> 01:57:05,515
This change was inevitable

1271
01:57:05,602 --> 01:57:08,185
from the moment we brought the first
dinosaur back from extinction.

1272
01:57:10,023 --> 01:57:12,060
We convince ourselves
that sudden change

1273
01:57:12,150 --> 01:57:14,061
is something that happens outside
the normal order of things,

1274
01:57:14,194 --> 01:57:16,276
like a car crash,

1275
01:57:17,030 --> 01:57:19,442
or that it's beyond our
control, like a fatal illness.

1276
01:57:19,533 --> 01:57:23,276
We don't conceive of sudden,
radical, irrational change

1277
01:57:23,370 --> 01:57:26,203
as woven into
the very fabric of existence.

1278
01:57:27,374 --> 01:57:30,366
Yet, I can assure you,
it most assuredly is.

1279
01:57:30,502 --> 01:57:32,163
And it's happening now.

1280
01:57:35,382 --> 01:57:38,875
Humans and dinosaurs are now
gonna be forced to coexist-

1281
01:57:42,973 --> 01:57:45,510
These creatures
were here before us.

1282
01:57:46,685 --> 01:57:48,847
And if we're not careful,
they're gonna be here after.

1283
01:57:55,277 --> 01:57:58,269
We're gonna have to adjust to new
threats that we can't imagine.

1284
01:58:05,036 --> 01:58:06,652
We've entered a new era.

1285
01:58:08,707 --> 01:58:11,199
Welcome to Jurassic World.
